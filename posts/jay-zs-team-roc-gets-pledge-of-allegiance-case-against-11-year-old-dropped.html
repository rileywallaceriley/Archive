    <h1>JAY-Z's Team ROC Gets Pledge Of Allegiance Case Against 11-Year-Old Dropped</h1>

    <div class="content"><p>Roc Nation's social justice arm, Team ROC, has taken yet another stand against injustice within the American legal system and successfully had the case of Jabari Talbot officially dismissed. The 11-year-old Florida sixth-grader was arrested last month after refusing to stand up for the pledge of allegiance in class.“Jabari is a courageous and intelligent young man who deserves all the credit for standing up for his beliefs,” sais appointed attorney Alex Spiro via statement. “He should’ve never been arrested or entangled in this situation—his freedom of speech rights were clearly protected under the 1st Amendment.”The same day Spiro -- who most recently worked to secure 21 Savage's release from ICE detainment -- took on the case, it was confirmed to have been dropped."Jabari Talbot was arrested in school after he exercised his right to not participate in the Pledge of Allegiance ... We stand with Jabari and his mother to stop the over-policing and criminalization of Black students," Team ROC wrote via Twitter.According to a report, Talbot refused to recite the pledge of allegiance, stating “The flag was racist and the national anthem was offensive to Black people.” After an exchange with his teacher, he was arrested by a school resource officer, who later claimed Talbot didn't abide by commands.The arrest affidavit adds that he threatened the teacher with violence and noted to his principal and the arresting officer that he would get them fired.[apple_news_ad type="standard”]​</p></div>
