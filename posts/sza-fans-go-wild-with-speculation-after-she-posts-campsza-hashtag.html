    <h1>SZA Fans Go Wild With Speculation After She Posts #CAMPSZA Hashtag</h1>
    <div class="meta">2017-09-15 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>After TDE artist SZA sent out an enigmatic tweet on (Wednesday) September 13, fans hoping for a collaboration with rapper K Camp think their prayers have possibly been answered. SZA simply posted the hashtag #CAMPSZA, which consequently led to her followers wildly speculating about what it means.Earlier this summer, super fans of SZA were elated when "Cut Her Off" rapper dropped a response to her side-chick anthem, "The Weekend" from her highly anticipated album CTRL.In the freestyle's final bars, K Camp seemed to send a shot at the singer when he rapped, "Please tell SZA she can come see me/ you know I got Love Galore on repeat ... shawty what you mean?/ You deserve this dick."Fans were all over it, as you can see from this handful of Tweets.Many fans seemed to echo a similar sentiment, SZA should definitely connect with the Atlanta rapper.While the details of what #CAMPSZA actually means are virtually non-existent, fans immediately pledged their undying support.</p>
<p>Whether it's indeed a one-off collaboration between the two artists, a full-blown LP or something completely unrelated — like an actual camp — it's clear her fans are always ready for more SZA.Check out the Twitter reactions below.</p></div>
