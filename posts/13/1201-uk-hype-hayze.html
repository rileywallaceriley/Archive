  <h1>UK Hype: Hayze</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Hailing from across the pond in Southampton, England, comes Hayze, who’d I’d classify as closely related to Trap.</p><p>It’s funny upon my initial listen, I didn’t even notice he wasn’t from the US — that is until I realized I didn't fully understand the geographical references he was dropping.</p><p>I’ll start with some background.</p><p>Coming from a poor household, Hayze notes that he focused on music as, “It was truly all I had growing up." He refined his craft and developed a sound that is all about connecting with listeners through high-energy production, uplifting melodies, and a thought-provoking lyrical flow.</p><p>His debut EP featured a random and unusual collaboration with Bizarre from Eminem’s infamous D12 crew — and a ton of gems worth multiple spins.</p><p>Also, he’s white — get over it.</p><p>Some of his YouTube haters seemed to think that mattered; it doesn’t.</p><p>Now, his music is insanely quality — like, at a level that most of the big dogs in the industry are at.</p><p>Production wise, he works almost exclusively with  with Jojo Farinella, Multi-instrumentalist, producer, singer and songwriter from the UK, who is lacing him with some of the filthiest trap beats we’ve heard in a while here at AAHIPHOP.</p><p>Hayze is currently in the lab finishing off his debut full-length project but graced us with three cuts from the release.</p><p>They had us open!</p><p>Let’s start with the drug trafficking anthem, “Mayans! ” featuring Triggz, where he proclaims that he wants to “make enough dough to disappear like the Mayans.” The beat here is bonkers; and, we’d be surprised if you didn’t start hearing some major players in the (US) market rocking to Jojo Farinella beats.</p><p>Menace is turning the UK into a go-to-market for beats.</p><p>Next up, he professes his desire for girls around the globe on the record “She Whoooo.” This track is club/radio ready, so DJ’s should get up on it while it’s fresh.</p><p>Lastly, “Loyalty,” is chalk full of quotable like, “They try to tell you they ain’t fake, funny, that’s what fakers say.”

Hayze is a good look, and his album — based on the samples he has chosen to share — should be a dope listen as well.</p><p>His colour shouldn’t be an issue, unless he starts talking in a southern (US) accent .</p><p>Bump his latest, and stay tuned for his greatest.</p><p>Early.
