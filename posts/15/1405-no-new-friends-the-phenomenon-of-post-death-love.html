  <h1>No New Friends: The Phenomenon Of Post Death Love</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Reminder, there's no shame in not being the biggest fan of an artist.</p><p>You're also not under any moral obligation to fundamentally love every artist who ever died.</p><p>Feels like that shouldn't be a necessary reminder — except that it is.</p><p>Master P said during a long-winded Instagram post/caption that we need to lift up and celebrate the best and brightest in our culture while they're still alive.</p><p>He went on to accuse BET of showing fake love to the memory of Prodigy, who passed away last week from complications related to Sickle Cell Anemia.</p><p>Let's explore that.

Prodigy — half of Mobb Deep — was a pillar of realness that represented that lost 90s era where authenticity reigned supreme.</p><p>While Prodigy has a vast catalog of content, it's not unrealistic to assume that a significant portion of (the more casual) Hip Hop listeners love for P peaked in two very specific eras.</p><p>Mobb's classic sophomore album — specifically "Shook Ones" — and the commercial singles in the period between <i>Infamy</i> and <i>Blood Money</i>.</p><p>I'll admit that's a hunch.</p><p>Numbers do point that way, though.</p><p>The farther we from <i>Blood Money</i>, the less commercial impact P was able to make.</p><p>His debut solo <i>H.N.I.C</i> went gold, but — while the two subsequent installments <i>did</i> manage to chart — his solo releases never received any further certifications.</p><p>What happened to the love?</p><p>Like many artists who have passed before him, P had suddenly popped up on everyone's (above the underground) radar last week After his sudden passing, with many crediting him as their 'favourite' rapper.</p><p>It's not a bad thing, and unfortunately an artist's passing often spurs newfound interest in their discography.</p><p>However, when a network like BET suddenly becomes the "biggest champion" of an artist they've all but forgotten over the past decade, it seems oddly opportunistic — if not, fake (as hell).</p><p>Much like Pac, Big, Sean P, and others we've lost along the way (like Phife), Prodigy is now finding himself on lots of top rappers lists, when — in actuality — he should have been there all along if that's how you feel.</p><p>The trouble is that celebration of vets like P would sure take up a lot of mental real estate that is currently is spent celebrating new and upcoming acts.</p><p>There needs to be balance; there needs to be something.</p><p>Anything.</p><p>Why are we the only genre that does this?We have architects who have over the way starving.</p><p>WTF?</p><p>Isn't it weird that people say "it's about time" when Pac was inducted into the Rock-N-Roll Hall Of Fame, but couldn't be bothered to shell out the $35 to help support the development and celebration of the <a href="http://hiphophof.tv/">Hip-Hop Hall Of Fame</a>?</p><p>The frustration of an act like Master P is understandable, as he (while not as lyrically gifted) has made similar impacts on the culture which he is not as recognized for as he could be.</p><p>I get it.</p><p>You should, too.</p><p>Younger heads should do their homework, and at least try to understand P's impact on the game.</p><p>He has lots of great music for you to discover.</p><p>But you don't have to hold him up as the greatest to ever do it.</p><p>It's ok to love or rekindle a love for fallen soldiers, but dick riding the dead for good optics is unnecessary.</p><p>Pause.</p><p>PS read his book.</p><p>It's in <em>my </em>Top 5.</p></div>
