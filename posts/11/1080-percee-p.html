  <h1>Percee P: The Lost Interview</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><blockquote>Look at Eminem -- when I met him he was like, "I've heard of you!".</p><p>That was a&amp;nbsp;testament&amp;nbsp;to the hard&amp;nbsp;work I put in to make a name for myself.

- Percee P</blockquote>
A few years back I was writing for another blog, doing a bi-weekly column called #DITC.</p><p>I was, in essence, interviewing artists that I'd looked up, and talking about the state of hip-hop.</p><p>While working on this wonderful interview I did with the "rhyme inspector" Percee P, I decided to split ways with the site.</p><p>As a result, this piece was in limbo – until now.</p><p>See below for my <i>lost</i> interview with Percee P.

<strong>It’s dope to see your battle (with Lord Finesse), a piece of hip-hop history, on YouTube.</p><p>The only thing is that the ice cream truck in the second video.</strong>

Yeah, yeah, I didn’t like that either!</p><p>You know, ice cream trucks are trying to make money, so I guess he saw them people over there, and just pulled up like he didn’t know he was interrupting.</p><p>I didn’t like it because I felt like I was being drowned out.</p><p>I just kept going, but it was just like damn!</p><p>You know what I’m saying?

<strong>There’s a quote on a blog that says you’re the "greatest rapper never to get his due. " What was your experience trying to get on?</strong>

I didn’t shop a demo.</p><p>My whole career, I was never really trying to get a deal or&amp;nbsp;shop to all these labels.</p><p>I never did that.</p><p>I never wanted to fall into traps, like all the other sucker artists getting down with labels and getting shelved.</p><p>Not just getting shelved, but locked into contracts that restrict you from even putting out music.</p><p>I looked at artists at the time like DMX -- I knew him personally, we were down with the same management -- who was doing his thing at the time.</p><p>He put out a record on Columbia, but they didn't push it as well as they could have.</p><p>I guess when they put out his debut (on Def Jam) they likely had to buy out his contract, but he was out for years before that, just on pause.</p><p>So I just didn't want that happening to me.</p><p>I’d rather hustle my music on the street.</p><p>I'd rather do that than be stuck with people that don't understand me and don’t know how to push me correctly.</p><p>Labels control artists, and how they come out.</p><p>Any label that thinks of themselves as “hip-hop” –&amp;nbsp;I think – should be proud to have even me as a part of their roster.</p><p>For the fact that I have something that a lot of other artists can't buy.</p><p>Even if they have more money, they can't but the experiences I've had in this game.</p><p>I've lived hip-hop.</p><p>I've seen a lot of stuff that people have to read about or look at DVD's to experience.</p><p>As it stands all these influencers (labels/investors), really just judge people off of hype and not off of their stripes.</p><p>Like if people were judged off of their stripes, people like me would be platinum.

<strong>What's your take grinding to build a name/brand independently?&amp;nbsp;Where did you draw your inspiration from?</strong>

I grew up in that era when you had to get out there and do you thing -- sing/hustle on corners just to get known.</p><p>So that’s me, and where I'm coming from.</p><p>But nowadays, with the technology, I don’t need to do all that.</p><p>I just need the views and hits.</p><p>The downside is that sometimes people like/watch and download an artist (assuming they have legit views), but the fans don’t know them, or get to know them.</p><p>When people talked about me, before I moved here (Cali) and even while I was in Cali, they'd say "damn, he’s everywhere".</p><p>It was important to me that people get more than just music.</p><p>I rock shows and go through the crowd -- walking through by myself -- taking pictures, answering questions.</p><p>No one knows your story better than you.</p><p>Those are the ideals I got from my heroes -- the unsung heroes -- who weren't about the videos and all that.</p><p>It wasn't about the about the hits and the views or the songs played on the radio.</p><p>People that were ahead of his their time.</p><p>Groups like Fearless Four, that’s what inspired me.</p><p>But I feel inspired by the new artists of today.</p><p>People are making money pushing their own thing -- blowing up doing this.</p><p>You don't need to rely on outside sources to make it happen for you.</p><p>You can hustle and get die-hard fans to follow you.</p><p>You don’t have to sell a million to be a millionaire; you know what I’m saying?

<strong>Why do you think it's important for fans to support local/underground hip-hop?</strong>

It's crucial to support the artists, like myself that are still around, trying to preserve what you complain about.</p><p>Like "damn man they don't do this anymore, they don’t do that." When you got cats doing it still, preserve that, by…

<strong>Helping support?</strong>

Exactly!

<strong>How important is that (preserving the culture)to you?</p><p>What role should artists/labels play?</strong>

I think they should make it mandatory to know the culture of hip hop.</p><p>Do you want a record deal?</p><p>OK, this is what you got to do.</p><p>You must learn the culture; learn it so that you can appreciate it more.</p><p>Understand what they (forefathers of the culture) had to go through to do hip hop.</p><p>They didn’t have YouTube like you.</p><p>You got videos and radio shows to hit up and people online doing blogs about you.</p><p>They didn't.</p><p>Taker a closer look and see what it was like back then in that territory; notice the condition and economic times they were facing.</p><p>What they had to go through to live, the thoughts they had.</p><p>They didn’t have the equipment we have now.</p><p>Pro-tools and things like that weren't around, so learn what they had to create with and what they did to propel the culture.</p><p>People didn’t have funding and people believing in them.</p><p>When they were going through it, it wasn’t even a recognized form of music.</p><p>Grown folks didn't know what they (the kids) were doing, making a bunch of noise out in these parks, heating people up.</p><p>They sacrificed their lives to inspire others, and another generation.</p><p>I’m one of those kids that were inspired because I felt positive things being done.</p><p>The parents might not have understood what was going on in the park, with thousands of people - but it made me say "I wanna become this, I wanna figure this out." Do it on the mic, go to another project, and then another project.</p><p>People got tapes of these unknown rappers blaring on box radios.</p><p>They didn't even have any&amp;nbsp;records, but they are playing recordings of them rhyming at a park or party or something.</p><p>You know, that inspired me.</p><p>To think, if those labels (back then) pushed and made names of people like Africa Bambata, Disco King Mario, and DJ Pete Jones -- who passed away recently.</p><p>People don’t know about them.</p><p>You supposed to know who they are, like the way you know Jay-Z and Lil' Wayne.</p><p>The kids know who they are.</p><p>Not even just their names.</p><p>They see a picture, "Oh that’s Lil' Wayne, that’s Jay-Z".</p><p>It’s a crime not to know these people .

<strong>What do you think needs to be done?</strong>

Appreciate people sometimes.</p><p>Don’t take me for granted like the air, the water, and the trees on the planet.</p><p>If you can understand what I am trying to say.</p><p>Most people just take that for granted.</p><p>We all need the trees, you know, but if all the trees get cut down, everybody dies on the planet.</p><p>See, I think like that, but people wait until the last minute before they try to divert things that’s happening.</p><p>You know what I’m saying?</p><p>Same thing with hip-hop&amp;nbsp;music.</p><p>Save it.</p><p>Save it right now.</p><p>There’s people still on the field, still trying to hold it up.</p><p>Not holding it down but holding it up.</p><p>Like yo, I’m still here doing it.</p><p>I’m still keeping it hip-hop.</p><p>Even if you think people are not really into (real) hip-hop, I’m still doing it.</p><p>People say I’m trying to bring hip-hop back, but you know what?</p><p>I am not bringing anything back because I <em>never</em> left in the first place!
