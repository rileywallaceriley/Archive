  <h1>R.A. The Rugged Man Murders Taylor Swift's "Look What You Made Me Do" Beat</h1>
  <div class="meta">2017-09-12 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Even though the old Taylor Swift can't come to the phone right now, the old R.A. The Rugged Man can (and will) answer the call to drop some bars — every time.The rap vet honored a challenge from one of his fans to freestyle over the instrumental to Swift's "Look What You Made Me Do," which now holds the record for the the fastest-selling download since Ed Sheeran's "Shape of You."During the two-minute and 17-second track, he touches on everything from Trump's tweeting habits to Kanye West's infamous MTV Video Music Awards mic grab in 2009."I like that song," he says in the freestyle's intro. "It's cute ... it's stupid.</p><p>I like it."The song also briefly features an appearance from his daughter who he says he was holding as he rocked the mic, establishing some serious dad goals."Now you hear my baby in my arms and she crying, she won't let daddy put her down when he's rhyming," he spits.This is the second display of what it means to be a true MC in the last 48 hours from the New York native.</p><p>On Monday (September 11), he responded to a fan who inquired about whether he could beat Eminem in a battle."I come from an era when you either believed you could destroy all competition or you didn't pick up a mic," he wrote.He and Slim Shady never actually collaborated, but when Em was on a serious uprise, many Hip Hop fans made pretty consistent stylistic comparisons between the two.</p><p>Some claimed Em bit his contextual content and flow.This led a handful of labels to attempt to pit R.A. against Em."When  blew up, I had every label on the planet telling me, 'Do a diss record for us,'" he told DJ Vlad in an interview.Correction: An earlier version of this article inaccurately called "Every Record Label Sucks Dick" a response to labels wanting R.A. to diss Em.</p><p>This is not the case.</p><p>We regret the error.</p></div>
