  <div class="content"><p>Earlier this week, Twitter was abuzz after hearing a snippet of Quavo‘s Joe Budden jab on the song “Ice Tray" from the Quality Control Control The Streets Vol 1 compilation.</p><p>Now it appears that a video could be in the works and that Migos are looking to cast lookalikes of all three hosts of Everybody Struggle (Joe Budden, Nadeska Alexis, and DJ Akademiks).The two crews faced off in a now-infamous interview at the 2017 BET Awards in June.Nadeska herself first brought attention to the ad that appeared on casting website Backstage.</p><p>Though the specifics of the roles have since been removed from the listing, screenshots are forever.According to the listing, the video is shooting in Atlanta on December 10.After hearing the “Ice Tray” snippet, Budden shared his thoughts with the panel on Everyday Struggle. didn’t appear to be taking the diss too seriously, noting, “I have no issue with any of you gentlemen over there.</p><p>I think y’all move the culture forward.</p><p>I want y’all to continue to do that however the fuck you can.</p><p>You feed a lot of people.</p><p>Mumble, young man, mumble.”It should be noted that casting lookalikes in videos is nothing new...</p><p>We can only imagine the headlines if social media had existed when Dr.</p><p>Dre and Snoop cast an Eazy-E imposter in “Dre Day” or when 2Pac cast Puff Daddy and Biggie lookalikes for his “2 Of Amerika’s Most Wanted” video.https://youtu.be/BL6dWDfs5x8</p></div>
