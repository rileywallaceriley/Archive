--Xleoniduz</blockquote>
Miami, Florida, rapper Xleoniduz has been featured here a few times now, and this time around, he's hit us with two brand new singles.</p><p>They are both quite different from each other, providing more insight into his environment and past than we've seen thus far in his freestyles.</p><p>The first of the two records, "Front Door," is a look into the mind of a trapper who is a product of his environment; the song is  a glimpse into his past pre-rap-life rap focus. "I remember being broke and having no hope...serving fiends right at that corner store." There is usually only a few ways out of that life, the song is both a street-kid anthem and celebration of advancement.</p><p>The second record, "Dade County," is an ode to his stomping grounds--which happens to be one of the top 20 most dangerous cities in America.</p><p>The slow, bassy record features fellow Miami rapper L.E.O., an artist and painter who is also starting to bubble; you can check out his <a href="http://vimeo.com/157779408">short film here</a> if you're interested.</p><p>As usual, we're digging his stuff.</p><p>We'll continue to keep you up to date with his releases as they drop.</p><p>For now, knock around the new records below, and mash the share button if you're feeling it too.
