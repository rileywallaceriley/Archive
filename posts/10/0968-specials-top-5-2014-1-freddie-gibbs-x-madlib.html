  <h1>Special’s Top 5 of 2014: #1 Freddie Gibbs x Madlib</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Former CTE records artist has a habit of making deep introspective music.</p><p>Madlib has a habit of being an OCD producer who makes brilliant soulful beats that are so dope they can stand on their own without any lyrics.</p><p>Together they blessed the world this year with <em>Piñata</em> – a project name that actually doubles as a "group" name.

<!--more-->Upon first listen, it's impossible for fans to not instantly compare the production focus and playlist flow of the album to<em> Madvillain</em>, Madlib's collaborative album with the ever illusion MF Doom.</p><p>Piñata, however, benefits from being slightly more linear (topic wise).</p><p>Gibbs rides the soulful beats on tracks like Deeper, Thuggin' and Scarface – exploring lost love, street life and retrospective hindsight.

It's such a dope album – from start to finish.</p><p>Contributions come from the likes Raekwon, Earl Sweatshirt, Danny Brown, Domo Genesis, Scarface, BJ the Chicago Kid, Ab-Soul, Casey Veggies, Meechy Darko, Mac Miller, and more.</p><p>Piñata is easily my top album of year, and a must-listen for ANYONE who considers themselves a hip-hop head.</p><p>Hopefully, unlike Madvillain, we don't spend the rest of our lives waiting for a proper follow-up.</p><p>Available everywhere you cop music - A MUST LISTEN.
