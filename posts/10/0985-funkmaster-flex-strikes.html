  <h1>Funkmaster Flex Strikes – Again!</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Hip-Hop Twitter was a buzz this weekend over a rant that Hot 97 DJ Funkmaster Flex unleashed upon <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/2052808/funkmaster-flex-jay-z-rant/">Jay-Z</a> and his <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/2051498/dj-funkmaster-flex-rant-jay-z/"><em>Life + Times</em> web team/writers</a>.</p><p>His beef arose when a rep from Life + Times, who flex alleges had previously stolen ideas from his mobile app after an interview, emailed to ask for his involvement in the Dipset reunion – Flex took issue, as did the Dipset.</p><p>What followed was a lot of stuff that will be hard to take back and a promptly released, sub-par, and frankly immature <a href="https://soundcloud.com/djfunkflexapp/ifwt-exclusive-the-diplomats-victory-freestyle-dipset2015">early 2000's sounding diss track</a>.

However, this is far from the first time that Funkmaster Flex, who got his start DJing the infamous Tunnel Nightclub, has used his status and platform to air grievances.</p><p>Below I've compiled some of his most uncomfortable moments.
<blockquote>“Don’t play with me man, don’t play with me...play me like I’m stupid, you’re going to see a different dude firing off on you. <i>On you</i>.”

– Funkmaster Flex</blockquote>
<strong>Flex vs Mr.</p><p>Cee Haters</strong>

When the legendary Mr.</p><p>Cee, who is credited with helping discover an up and coming rapper named Biggie Smalls (no <em> big</em> deal), was arrested for soliciting a male prostitute, many fans were quick to denounce him.</p><p>Flex, his longtime friend, came to his defence with a <a href=" to end all rants</a>.</p><p>It started with a <em>we don't discriminate</em> warning and ended with Flex all but <em>assuring</em> Cee's innocence and aiming crosshairs at Power 105.</p><p>Cee has since come (partially) <a href="http://youtu.be/ngUrhkxhFeg">clean about everything</a>, and left the station.

<strong>Flex vs Nicki Minaj</strong>

After Peter Rosenberg announced that Nicki Minaj was not real hip-hop live during Summer Jam, the hip-hop/pop diva was instructed by the YMCMB capo (Lil' Wayne) not to hit the stage – and she complied.</p><p>Flex's response to the situation was to air her out on every platform he could.</p><p>This escalated to a very tense (and kind of epic) <a href=" that was both insightful and hard to listen to (at some points).

<strong>Flex vs <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Nas</span> Steph Lova</strong>

During an interview with Steph Lova, Nas, who is one of the most prolific lyricists of our generation, accused Flex of accepting <a href="http://www.daveyd.com/articleflexpayola.html">payola to play records</a>.</p><p>If you're not familiar, this means Flex was breaking the first rule of radio and accepting bribes to play records that may not otherwise make it to air – not completely unbelievable, and <em>highly</em> illegal.</p><p>What should have been a war of words with Esco himself turned into an assault charge as Flex confronted and laid hands on <a href="http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.1222/title.funk-flex-assaults-steph-lova">Steph Lova the next day</a>.

<strong>Flex vs 2Pac Fans</strong>

There is one thing that hip-hop fans, depending on their personal taste, can never agree on: Biggie vs Tupac.</p><p>So it's understandable that Flex rubbed some heads the wrong way (pause) when he proclaimed live on stage that he didn't feel as though he needed to suck and/or ride 2Pac's penis like most fans – rather, as a New Yorker his horse in the race was the late Biggie Smalls.</p><p>Wow, just wow. <a href=" that footage here</a>.

<hr />

Moral of the story is that Flex is opinionated and really has<em> zero fucks</em> to give about your opinion.</p><p>With over 20 years in the game, maybe he's earned the right – it certainly does make for good radio!
