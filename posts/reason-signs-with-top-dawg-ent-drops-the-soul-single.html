    <div class="content"><p>Top Dawg Entertainment has officially welcomed Del Amo, California's Reason to the family. The label announced his signing on Wednesday (August 8) with the release of a new single titled "The Soul."Earlier this year, the up-and-coming MC appeared on the TDE-curated Black Panther soundtrack.</p>
<p>He was one of the contributors on the song "Seasons."In February, Reason teased his TDE signing in an interview with Rolling Out."Although the Black Panther soundtrack is a huge accomplishment, the soundtrack will not be the biggest thing I do this year," he said.The signing and release of "The Soul" come ahead of Reason's first tour with fellow TDE artist Jay Rock. He'll be a supporting act on The Big Redemption Tour, which begins on September 12."First tour ... and to be going with a west coast legend is beyond humbling," he wrote on Instagram. "I just wanna thank everybody that’s been rocking with me since day.</p>
<p>This is a win for the whole city."[apple_news_ad type="any"]</p></div>
