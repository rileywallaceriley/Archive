    <h1>Twitter Goes Nuts Over Slanderous LL Cool J Career Retrospective</h1>
    <div class="meta">2018-12-19 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Fans of pioneering Hip Hop icon LL Cool J were less than pleased after Vulture writer Pete Tosiello penned what was described in the headline as an honest evaluation of the 50-year-old legend's entire career.Published Monday (December 17) and framed as a response to Uncle L’s 5th Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame snub, the article set out to give a devil’s advocate look at why he may not as deserving of the honor as everyone thinks.Describing Mr. Smith as a “vaguely handsome, vaguely likable translator of hip-hop for the American Top 40 audience,” the writer made some of his most subversive comments in the intro, before breaking down his catalog.“LL Cool J, the icon, is a malleable meathead, a purveyor of stone-cold old-school classics, novelty hits, and spoken-word melodrama,” he writes. “With LL, what you see is what you get, and a lot of the time that’s a musclebound B-list action star making duckfaces at the camera.”However, Hip Hop Twitter was quick to pan the piece’s comments about his depth and — most curiously — physical appearance.Aside from being the first Hip Hop artist to receive Kennedy Center Honors — a commemoration of lifetime contributions to American culture — LL Cool J has largely transcended the genre and became a widely recognizable pop-culture figure.The two-time Grammy Award-winner and NAACP Image Award winner has racked up a respectable resume outside of just his music over the past three decades. Unfortunately, the grandeur of his career is largely glossed over entirely.You can read the full Vulture editorial, here.[apple_news_ad type="standard"]​</p></div>
