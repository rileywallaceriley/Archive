  <h1>AAHIPHOP Magazine Issue 1</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Welcome to the jump off of Above Average Hip-Hop – now available in a <a href="http://issuu.com/aahiphop">magazine format</a>.</p><p>You may have some questions, and I have some answers.</p><p>First, why are we branching out from our growing website?</p><p>Well, because of the feedback we've received, and the general acceptance from the community at large.</p><p>The content is just getting too good, and it felt like it needed to be immortalized in a more artistic and permanent way.</p><p>Secondly, how will this work?</p><p>Well, here's an easy answer: I have no idea.</p><p>I've never made a magazine.</p><p>I am, however, a writer and a real head who loves to nerd out with my icons and do my part to break new talent.

<span style="line-height: 24px;">The truth is, I've always wanted to make my own magazine, and as a child, I never imagined I'd have the ability (literally – technology is bonkers), or the content at my disposal.</p><p>So maybe, even though I'm in my early 30's, this magazine is some sort of bucket list checkmark.</p><p>When I became a member of the Universal Zulu Nation, I did so with the hopes that I'd be able to somehow help spread the culture I love, and help to further document not just the overlooked history, but the new chapters being (physically) written by the next generation.</span>

This magazine is a physical companion piece to aboveaveragehiphop.com, and I urge you to explore the pieces there as well, as they will often include mixes, videos and other multimedia components that will add further context.</p><p>I envision this remaining relatively digital, but perhaps becoming available in limited physical edition.</p><p>So let's see where this takes us.</p><p>Thanks for all the support and love!</p><p>Peace!
