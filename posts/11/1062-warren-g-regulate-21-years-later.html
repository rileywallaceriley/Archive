  <h1>Warren G: Regulate, 21 Years Later</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Some 2-3 years after the release of Dr.</p><p>Dre's (monumental) post-NWA solo debut album <i>The Chronic</i>, we were introduced to the true definition of "chemistry".</p><p>Warren G (Dr.Dre's step-brother), along with long beach crooner Nate Dogg, bum-rushed the rap world with their breakthrough single, <i><a href=" The gritty tale, flipped over Michael McDonald's I Keep Forgetting, became an instant classic and cemented the two in hip-hop history.</p><p>Now 21 years later, Warren G effortlessly rekindles the charm of his classic debut album, and career-shadowing mega-hit with his new EP, <i><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/regulate...-g-funk-era-pt./id1020512625">Regulate...</p><p>The G Funk Era Part II</a></i>.</p><p>At a short four songs long, the project clocks in at just 15 minutes.</p><p>Nate Dogg appears on all of the songs – and it's wonderful.</p><p>I initially thought the album would come off as more as a "tribute", but I was <i>way</i> wrong.</p><p>With the exception of a reference to him being "in heaven" by Jeezy on the head nodding <i>Keep On Hustlin</i>, which also features Bun B, there are no RIPs here.</p><p>There is also no forced attempt to sound as though this EP was recorded in 1995.</p><p>It seems modern, clean and is dripping in g-funk. <i>Saturday</i>, featuring E-40 and Too $hort took me back to my high school days when Long Beach ran shit.</p><p>The uptempo ear candy made me reminiscent of 90's BBQ's, just kicking in on the basketball court and everything I love about summer.</p><p>Dropping a part two of your debut on the 20th anniversary is becoming a played out attempt by some artists to capitalize on their legacy.</p><p>This isn't that.</p><p>It's also likely why Warren let that milestone pass.</p><p>As 2/3 of 213, the original trio that included Snoop, Nate and Warren have a timeless "je ne sais quoi" that can only happen organically, and in some cases, once in a lifetime (if ever).</p><p>They're examples of a perfect sonic combination – not unlike Scarface, Bushwick and Willie D. Most of all, they're legends who helped to pioneer the g-funk sound that seems to make a resurgence thanks to a new generation of artists like YG and Kendrick Lamar. <i>The G Funk Era Part II</i> is another extension of their legacy.</p><p>It's a must-have for OG fans, and a fitting metaphorical "pouring of liquor" for one of the hottest hook-makers in the history of hip-hop.</p><p>RIP Nate Dogg!</p></div>
