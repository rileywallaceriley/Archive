  <h1>Mad Skillz' "Ghostwriter" Could Really Be One Of The Ballsiest Tracks Of All Time</h1>

<p>Something I often consider is how crazy some of my fav songs and moments in Hip Hop would be if they happened in an age where Twitter was a thing.</p><p>There is one song I keep finding myself revisiting in every conversation I have on the topic; after seeing a copy of it on wax during a recent dig, I felt compelled to force all of you to revisit its brazen brilliance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is no doubt that if Mad Skillz's 2000 Rawkus release "Ghostwriter" were to drop right now — in today's climate — it would be the most buzzed-about song in history.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Period.</p>

<p>For those not aware of the record, it's possibly the most ballsy warning shot of all time.</p><p>Skillz was well known as a ghostwriter in the industry, crafting countless hits — dominating Billboard in his prime.</p><p>However, he found himself having a considerable amount of headaches attempting to collect funds for the (life-changing) services he rendered to artists (who were mainly superstars).&amp;nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have always thought being a ghostwriter must be an odd experience.</p><p>Imagine having to hear chart-topping singles everywhere you go and accept that nobody but you is aware of your involvement.</p><p>But, I imagine watching artists live their best lives while singing your songs and not paying for it would be infuriating.&amp;nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was the case for Skillz, who decided to put the artists in his accounts receivable list on blast. "Ghostwriter" is a firsthand account of how he effortlessly crafted hits for artists who have yet to pay up — bleeping their names.</p><p>The best part was, the third verse threatened to drop an uncensored version if he didn't get his money.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Can you even imagine if this happened today?&amp;nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The use of ghostwriters is something that will follow Drake for the rest of his career.</p><p>Regardless if it affects bottom-line sales, it affects credibility in real rap circles.</p><p>In the case of Drizzy, though, fans were left to process one revelation.</p><p>Imagine if you learned the top 10 artists you loved weren't writing — all in one sitting.&amp;nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It wasn't until years later when footage surfaced of Skillz singing an uncut version.</p><p>Imagine how saucy this would have been on the timeline.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>In a 2015 <a href=" with White Label Radio, he revealed that the bluff worked — with many of the artists promptly paying him what he described as "hush money."&amp;nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whenever we hear debates about best diss records, this song is never mentioned, which is criminal.</p><p>Even though it didn't reveal the targets, the bars were so direct you couldn't help but speculate.</p><p>It was justified extortion and (in some cases) could have been a career-ending injury for those named.</p><p>Savagery in the highest form.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take a few minutes to revisit this classic.&amp;nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early.</p>
