  <h1>Hip Hop Icons Run-DMC, LL Cool J & Salt-N-Pepa Set To Rock Twitch Event</h1>
  <div class="meta">2020-08-05 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Following the success of his PASS THE MIC event this past July — which featured virtual performances from soul legends — DJ Cassidy is looking to take the series to the next level.</p><p>He'll be amassing 35 Hip Hop icons for a second volume via Twitch on Wednesday (August 5) to uplift and pay homage to the heroes around the world fighting for health, freedom and justice.In association with the LL Cool J founded Rock The Bells, the star-studded live video mixtape will include LL himself, Run-DMC, Salt-N-Pepa and a host of surprises."I hope Volume Two moves others as much as it has moved me," he noted. "I am forever grateful to my Hip Hop heroes for their decades of music, culture, and inspiration, and with them, I celebrate all the heroes around the world."The first volume came together during a quarantine FaceTime conversation between the celebrity DJ and his mentor/friend Verdine White of Earth Wind & Fire, he explained in an Instagram caption.</p><p>During the conversation, the group's triple-platinum selling classic "That's The Way Of The World" came on the speakers, which, as he recalls, brought much needed a sense of calm.Cassidy (known for rocking insanely high profile gigs like Obama's inauguration and JAY-Z and Beyoncé's wedding) wanted to bring the same feeling he had listening to classics in the presence of his idols to fans around the world.The result was a well-received streaming event featuring Philip Bailey and Verdine White of Earth, Wind, & Fire, Robert "Kool" Bell and Khalis Bayyan of Kool & The Gang, Bobby Brown, Ricky Bell of New Edition and many more.DJ Cassidy's second PASS THE MIC is premiering August 5 at 6 PM EST (9 PM PST) on his Twitch account.</p></div>
