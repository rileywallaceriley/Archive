  <h1>Chughey’s LP “Lost In My Mind” Is An Emotional Rollercoaster</h1>

  <div class="content"><p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’ve been quite vocal in the past about the importance of album sequencing — especially when it comes to the narrative arc of a project’s storyline (no matter How loose).</p><p>This is something that came into play when I was checking out this fascinating gem from Gladstone, Michigan, MC Chughey.</p><p>Lost In My Mind is unique in that out of context, some of the project’s lighter fare, such as the age-old money chase of ”Casino, ” create a fresh, grind-savvy impression of Chughey.</p><p>However, a top to bottom listen to his LP is, to say the least, a journey through the mind of a man dealing with more than he’s able to handle himself.</span></p>

&amp;nbsp;
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Starting off as a testament to the hustle he’s diligently dedicated himself to, “Maneuver” and “Nothing New” absolutely sparkle.</p><p>Self-produced, the project has pretty tight production, and Chughey’s cadence really pulls things together nicely.</p><p>It’s when we hit “Feels Right” that things start to take a turn for the dark.</p><p>What plays out as a complicated relationship that he’s unable to have fully reciprocated — despite deep emotional investment — plays into the next track “Deepest,” which sees him seemingly professing the stranglehold that love has over him, and how his aforementioned emotional investment simultaneously makes his object of affection a remedy and a weapon. “Off Of You,” is an uncomfortable confession that his demons destroyed the relationship he was in, and he is now struggling to exist without her engulfing his thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What stands out is “Fine,” which is a quintessential theme song for checking in on your friends.</p><p>The song is a heart-wrenching confession that though he — though his exterior is hardened — is experiencing a crisis on the inside.</p><p>We also learn as this portion of the tracklist progresses that he was numbing much of his emotions with alcohol; he later finds his way, and songs like the sunny “Wasted Days” feels like sunshine cutting through the haze that we’ve been taken through.</span></p>

&amp;nbsp;
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What happens when the plans change, and we get into a dark place?</p><p>Many people go through it, and for Chughey, sharing his experience — whether or not it’s genuinely autobiographical — is brave and necessary in a landscape where mental health has proven to be one our generation’s greatest threats.</p><p>While it definitely escalated quickly and probably isn’t a casual listen as a whole, it’s a worthwhile slice of honest, self-produced artwork.</span></p></p></div>
