  <h1>Divine – Ghetto Rhymin' LP</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>There's so many ways to get into the game – and it often comes down to who you know.</p><p>Luckily for Brooklyn (Fort Greene) rapper Divine, he knows venture capitalist Ben Horowitz.</p><p>After connecting initially on Twitter, the rapper and VC hit it off (because Ben was a huge hip-hop head).</p><p>Divine, at the time, was <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/divine/ghetto-rhymin-divines-official-debut-hip-hop-rap-a">trying to fund his debut album</a> <em>Ghetto Rhymin</em> on the popular funding platform Kickstarter.</p><p>Ben's wife, as well as some of his associates ended up giving generous pledges that led to the projects completion.

The album, which we'll off the bat say is very QB in a good way, is a solid 16 song effort.</p><p>Divine, who sounds like a hybrid of AZ, CNN and Tragedy Khadafi, provides few fillers and features, and instead focuses on bars.</p><p>He shines on stand-outs like <em>Brooklyn Brooklyn</em>, <em>Gun Talk</em> and <em>Hard Body</em>.</p><p>The fact that the album sounds like it could have been made 15 years ago (production and rhyme wise) may be a bit off putting for some newer listeners, and may not be for everyone; however, overall it's a great project.</p><p>All NYC hip-hop – definitely worth a listen.<br /><br />
