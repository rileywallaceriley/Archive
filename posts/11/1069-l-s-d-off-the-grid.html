  <h1>L.S.D – Off The Grid</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hip-hop truly is world-wide.</p><p>I’ll preface this by admitting that my knowledge of the hip-hop scene down-under is less than expansive, so if I sound off base at all, that’s why.</p><p>I recently came across an Aussie (Perth to be exact) artist that I’m really digging.</p><p>He goes by the name of L.S.D, and (to me anyways) he’s an Australian answer to <a href=" Kelly</a> .</p><p>Four years after his last release, a <em><a href="https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAAahUKEwiIuJygvcTHAhWHe5IKHReuBoI&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reverbnation.com%2Flsdmusic&amp;ei=QYDcVciTHYf3yQSX3JqQCA&amp;usg=AFQjCNFZaJV5JTLoeCyY06n6rdxkVR-v5g&amp;sig2=U0XHOLhbi3QGvtaCkbHRDA">Lighter Shade of Darkness</a></em>, and a brief retirement/hiatus, he’s returning to the scene with an album entitled <em><a href="https://lsdhiphop.bandcamp.com/album/off-the-grid">Off The Grid</a></em> – and he reached out to AAHIPHOP to spread some of his vibes.</p><p>I saw the obvious fit, because we’re big fans of Blackalicious over here (peep our <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/interview-with-gift-of-gab/">Gift of Gab</a> interview), and he very much fits into that pocket.</p><p>In fact, <a href=" worked with him</a> on his first album.</span></p>
His album is a wonderful mix of old school charm, <a href=" and Mighty</a>-esque sonic beds and turntablism (orchestrated by Rob Shaker).</p><p>To top it off, L.S.D has bars –like REALLY dope bars.</p><p>It’s a great listen.</p><p>After the first track, I didn’t even notice he had an accent at all, and the fact that he’s from Australia isn’t used as any sort of gimmick or on-running pun.</p><p>From the jump, with the high-energy title track, <em>Off The Grid</em>, L.S.D sets the tone, and carries the pace throughout with few missteps.</p><p>He tackles a range of topics from the staple “overcoming in the face of adversity” on the uptempo (very fun) <em>GO</em>, to soaking in the experience and perspective from a conversation with a 75 year-old on the song <em>Story To Tell</em>.</p><p>Standouts for me were the joints <em>Alive Again</em>, where he discusses universal true-school hip-hop relevancy struggles, the infidelity shaming <em>Cheaters</em> and the uptempo (sexy) sax laced <em>Rio</em>.


<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The album's overall strength lies in its intricacy.</p><p>The micro details (like the cuts) and the general quality – sonically <em>and</em> creatively – are top-notch.</p><p>It's a very solid effort, and with exception of a few references I just didn't understand, it was quite universal, while remaining true to what I perceive the Perth scene to be.</p><p>It's full of real-world stories, hardship and most of all, <em>substance</em>.</p><p>The fact that I'm limited by North American references to give this man context is a testament to my narrow-minded my view of the culture.</p><p>I'm going to work on that.</span></p>
