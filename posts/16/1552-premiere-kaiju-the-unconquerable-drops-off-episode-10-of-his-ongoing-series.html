  <h1>#Premiere: Kaiju The Unconquerable Drops Off Episode 10 Of His Ongoing Series</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>With his long awaited album finally ready to be unleashed, Kaiju — an artist I’ve been following (and championing) for a while now unveils his brand new visual, “CRINGEWORTHY.”
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Set in the no so distant year 2020, following a tie between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in the elections — which forced a mass recount, plunging the nation into chaos — martial law was implemented.</p><p>After citizens were forced into crime and stringent gang affiliation as a survival tactic, leading to historically high crime rates (98%), Nightmare Force ran by the Leader CRINGEWORTHY (Kaiju) formed to aid citizens and patrol areas from bandits and mobs.</span></p>
<p class="p1">The incredibly intricate storyline and visual experience is something we’ve come to expect from Kaiju; the some itself is an absolute earworm.</p><p>This guy is a crazy good lyricist, which makes his music even more fun as it stands alone, even without the visual accompaniment.</p>
It’s welcomed entry into the series — sitting amongst the top two, easily.</p><p>Check out the video, above.</p></div>
