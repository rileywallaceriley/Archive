Grind and hustle can never truly be appreciated by the general public; unless they're your day ones, they probably can't comprehend that you've been through a gang of peaks and valleys to get where you're at.</p><p>Producer/DJ Supe is a great example -- from making music and rocking parties while living in his car, to a  successful run as a radio station DJ, and active figure on the concert, festival, and club scene, he's put in work.</p><p>Currently, he's hitting the streets hard promoting his new release, "Guilty," a silky new tune with singer <a href="http://www.ayannacharlene.com/">Ayanna Charlene</a>.</p><p>We caught up with DJ Supe, who told us about the track, his influences and how he got started in the industry.

<b>How did you get started?</b>

I used to listen to "The God Emcee," Rakim, like all the time in elementary school!</p><p>So I started rapping and getting my flows tight.</p><p>My dad had an old reel to reel player, and I used to record myself over old Funkadelic records.</p><p>I had to splice the tape together when it broke from hours of playing it.</p><p>I got pretty good chopping them tapes together right on the beat and made my own mixtapes.</p><p>Started rapping freshman year but got drawn to deejaying my senior year.</p><p>My high school friends and I started a group called Flo-Magnum, and eventually Ebro called me to guest DJ when he had a radio show in my hometown Sacramento.. (peace to DJ Tone Pesci for letting me cover for him).</p><p>The rest is history.

<b>Production/DJ wise, who are some of your influences?</b>

Some of my influences on production are DJ Premier, Dr.</p><p>Dre, and The Neptunes.</p><p>My DJ influences are DJ Qbert, DJ Kid Capri and DJ Jazzy Jeff (he is going to spin at my wedding one day).</p><p>I like these guys because they cut and scratch, but they also know how to rock a party.</p><p>They won't scratch all off beat just to show you how fast their wrist is.</p><p>They do it fluidly – that's how I do it.</p><p>Most importantly, I can't forget the guys around here in California that raised me, DJ Gino, DJ Racer X, Sam Starks, and DJ Tosh who gave me a lot of good advice while spinning on the air.

<b>What are you currently promoting?</b>

Right now I am promoting a single I produced called "Guilty" which is on iTunes, Google Play, Tidal, Spotify, etc.</p><p>The artist who sang on the track is Ayanna Charlene, and the song is from her EP called <i>The Cut Off</i> that I wholly produced due out later this year.</p><p>I am also working closely with artists to showcase their videos on my #DJSupeQuickMix series.</p><p>They are 15-minute music video mixes that you can find on my <a href="http://www.djsupe.net">website</a>.</p><p>They are also available on my app DJ Supe Mobile, which is on The App Store for iOS and Google Play for Android devices.</p><p>Look for a few artists I am producing for on my EP called <i>Weirdo</i> due out Fall 2016; Tanjanae, Pacific Sunrise, Ruben Eaton, Carla Lawrence, and Genesis.

<b>How would you describe your production?</b>

My music is a fusion of modern Hip-Hop drums, Trip Hop, and downtempo ambient sounds.</p><p>I combine that with R&amp;B/Soul chords and instruments like Rhodes and organs to create a darker but still melodic flow.</p><p>Singers love it; rap artists that like to experiment with me find the groove, too.

<b>What are your goals in the industry?</b>

My goals are to make a living at what I do.</p><p>It's not about getting rich.</p><p>It's about establishing a legacy.</p><p>I love to spin records, but I also love to spin my records!</p><p>So I guess deejaying is the foundation.</p><p>Been doing a few concerts with Bombay VIP, which is the direction I want to go...more festivals and concerts.</p><p>Want to keep that going while I continue to develop artists under my production.</p><p>Having a hot single doesn't hurt either!

<b>What do you want people to take away from you as a producer?</b>

My tenacious work ethic is what I want people to recognize me for.</p><p>I work on music EVERY SINGLE DAY.</p><p>Not because I have to...but because I owe music.</p><p>I used to be homeless living in my car and making music and rocking parties AT THE SAME DAMN TIME!</p><p>That was the only thing that kept me going.</p><p>That is how I fed myself, so I am going to feed it back.</p><p>Give and take you know?</p></div>
