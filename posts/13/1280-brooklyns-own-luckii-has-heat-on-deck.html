  <h1>Brooklyn's Own LuCkii Has Heat On Deck</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Why we--as writers-- don't classify NYC street-hop as its own subgenre, alongside drill music, is beyond me.</p><p>I'm not talking that back pack rap that more introspective  outfits like Pro Era rarely sway from.</p><p>I'm talking the gritty NYC shit, that has--over the years--grown to encompass it's own youthful blend of trap, slow, bassy rap/sing compositions and even some straight up hip-hop.</p><p>All this, captured within that raw energy and perspective that only comes from roaming the streets of NYC with your hoody up and your pockets full of dirty money.</p><p>Brooklyn-based rapper LuCkii checks off a lot of the boxes.</p><p>With a catalog that dates back roughly four years, he has been quite consistent.</p><p>Some of the record I've come across, like the radio-ready "Never Cared,' which sees him singing over a slow-flow record that could easily fit into the contemporary mainstream rotation, and the more grimy "Under The Influence," show an impressive range that manages to stay true to his city.</p><p>He reminds of some of the Big Apple's other youthful heavy hitters, like Troy Ave.</p><p>He recently took a brief Q&amp;A for AAHH, which you can see below--this kid has some potential; check a out selection of career (video) highlights I've picked out.

<strong>Where were you born--and how did you get into music?
</strong>
I was born in Queens, New York.</p><p>However, I bounced around a few boroughs--even Long Island.</p><p>I now reside in Brooklyn.</p><p>I've been making music for 15+ years now; I started when I was 10.

<strong>How would you describe your music?
</strong>
When you listen to my music, and the  and feeling of my tracks, you can feel me because it's real shit.</p><p>But--most importantly--I drop gems .I don't wanna give away too many secrets; you gotta just listen.

<strong>Who are your influences?
</strong>
I grew up listening to Missy, Jay-Z, Stack Bundles , Max B; those were the biggest influences on me.

<strong>What's coming up for you?
</strong>
Right now, I'm finishing up a 5 song EP which is untitled--but, it's done.</p><p>Just going through the mixing process.</p><p>I recently released two songs on soundcloud "X-Files" and "Never Cared." Also, I have a big a announcement coming soon; stay tuned.
