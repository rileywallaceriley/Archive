  <h1>Erykah Badu – But You Caint Use My Phone (First Listen)</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>It's been a while since we heard the sultry, soulful voice of the talented Ms Erykah Badu.</p><p>The interwebs collectively made a happy sigh when she dropped the only cover of <i><a href=" Bling</a></i> that matters, sparking talks of a new mixtape entitled <i>But You Caint Use My Phone</i>, a nod to her infamous song <i><a href=" Well, the talks were true, and keeping her word, Erykah dropped her new mixtape on the world at midnight.</p><p>If you're a fan like me, you were anxiously waiting for a "green light" tweet to storm iTunes and hop on the soul train.</p><p>All aboard!</p><p>It's a ride that was worth the wait.</p><p>Off the top, I love EVERYTHING about this project; the cover, the arrangement, the loose theme, the fact that Drake is on two tracks – without any mention in the track listing – and just the overall feeling I get listening to this.</p><p>After the intro, which has he chanting the classic punchline of <i>Tyrone</i>, she gets into the cover that creatively jumpstarted the project, which I skipped.</p><p>Only because I'd listened to it about a million times by this point.</p><p>Next was the proper studio version of <i>Phone Down</i>, which she premiered on Periscope a few weeks ago.</p><p>The rest of the project was a completely fresh experience (double entendre intended).</p><p>She drops her neosoul take on the New Edition classic <i><a href=" Telephone Man</a></i>, and even a buttery electro-funk twist on Usher's <i><a href=" Don't Have To Call</a></i>.</p><p>The highlight for me, though, was the Andre 3000 featured <i>Hello</i>, which seems to morph organically into the sonic elements of Sade's <i><a href=" Of Love</a></i> – a classic record that was the main ingredient of MF DOOM's <i><a href=" The project is stitched together with Erykah's signature interludes and melodies and reprises.</p><p>It had a sound that would make for an amazing like show that I would pay upwards of $300 to see.</p><p>I’ve been a fan of Erykah since <i>Baduizm</i> dropped in my grade 9 school year.</p><p>I've followed her "on and on" ever since.</p><p>What I’ve always admired about her is her ability to give her fans exactly what they want.</p><p>She has yet to disappoint me. <i>You Caint Use My Phone</i> is no different.</p><p>It’s relevant and immediate (recorded within the past month or two).</p><p>She’s really good at using the internet machine, and this project is a great tangible example of that.</p><p>Pop it in, double click (or, however you will bump this) and zone out as you knock out your Black Friday shopping!
