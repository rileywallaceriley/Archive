  <h1>It's Dark and Hell Is Hot: DMX's Debut Turns 18</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>In their latest <a href="https://youtu.be/TZZB2gDYlkk">Great Hip-Hop Debates</a> podcast, XXL's EIC Vanessa Satten, Jack Thriller, Dj Suss One, and Torae, debated whether younger heads needed to be schooled on the history of the culture.</p><p>It was mostly in direct response to a recent controversy surrounding a tweet referring to Nas as Esco, which young-Twitter immediately jumped all over, accusing XXL of making an error .</p><p>One of the great takeaways, though, was that we need to take the initiative to teach younger generations about the history of the culture, when at all possible.</p><p>Well, today is the 18th anniversary of DMX's debut album, <i>It's Dark and He'll Is Hot</i>, and rather than merely pointing it out, I felt it necessary to be part of the solution and discuss why the album matters.</p><p>Today DMX is a shell of his former self; unfortunately, most 90's babies missed D in his heyday, so they may not understand why he gets a consecutive pass from the hip-hop community.</p><p>Allow me to break it down.</p><p>By the time May, 1998, rolled around, buzz for DMX’s impending full-length album was at a fever-pitch.</p><p>He’d made some serious noise dropping 16’s on some massive records the year before, namely Ma$e’s Debut album, <i>Harlem World</i>, LOX’s debut, <i>Money Power Respect</i>.</p><p>Not to mention, his verse on LL Cool J’s "1,2,3,4" — the song that started the beef between Canibus and LL .</p><p>So, when It’s Dark and Hell Is Hot hit the streets, hot on the heels of the single, Get At Me Dog, people lost their minds.</p><p>What Jeezy had (regarding an aura of authenticity) when he first dropped, X had in overabundance.</p><p>He was a hyper example of NYC’s gritty streets, circa the early 90s (think Onyx Bacdafucup) mixed with this inexplicable  appeal that had females open.</p><p>The record was a product of the good old days of Def Jam, when über meticulous attention was paid to creating full bodies of work.</p><p>The album was personal, aggressive, insightful, and catchy.</p><p>Records like Ruff Ryder’s Anthem and Get At Me Dog become anthems in the big apple, and nationwide.</p><p>Records that have always stuck out to me were "How’s It Goin’ Down", a record that sees D essentially letting go of a relationship with a married/taken woman, and "Damian," where D sells his soul to the devil in exchange for success — a storyline he picked up on subsequent albums.</p><p>The album sold over 200k in its first week, and two years later, was certified 4x platinum.</p><p>A mere seven months later (within the same calendar year), he released his follow-up album, which also reached 4x platinum status.</p><p>He became the first rap artist to have two number-one albums within one calendar year.</p><p>It may be younger heads to grasp how large DMX was, but numbers don't lie.</p><p>And those numbers are reductions.</p><p>He helped usher in names like Eve, Swizz Beats, and a host of others; and, was an inspiration to countless artists.</p><p>I'm not even going to get into Belly, and his other movie roles, or his other albums.</p><p>But, DMX's place in (hip-hop) history is well deserved.</p><p>He still packs shows, though, and as of late, seems to be on a more positive path.</p><p>It's been well publicized that his issues with drugs and alcohol have been a dark cloud over his career -- and more importantly his life -- for a better part of the last decade.</p><p>Listening to this album as I write, 18 years after first pumping it in my blue Sony Walkman during the summer of 1998, takes me right back to that time in my life.</p><p>It's true that much of the love D still gets is due to the nostalgic value of his classic catalog; however, the album is timeless.</p><p>It more than holds up -- and stacks up -- today, just as well as it did when it first dropped.</p><p>I still get the same feeling as I listen "How It's Goin' Down," reminiscing about an era that seems like yesterday, but is a lifetime ago.</p><p>If you've never indulged, give the album a spin.</p><p>If you're a real head, re-indulge.</p><p>All hail the Dark Man.
