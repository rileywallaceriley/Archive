  <h1>Habeas Corpus: Interview With Willie D of the Geto Boys</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>In today's hip-hop climate, where artists are here today and gone tomorrow, terms like classic and legend are grossly overused.</p><p>Artists from my era had to earn titles through consistency, longevity and – most importantly – building a brand and body of work that stands the test of time.</p><p>This is a level that includes artists like LL Cool J, Nas and Houston's own Geto Boys.

<a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_7875.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium" title="" src="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_7875.jpg" alt="" width="168" height="170" /></a>Assembled by J. Prince, the mastermind behind the southern powerhouse Rap-A-Lot Records, the group took many forms.</p><p>Ultimately, the grouping of Scarface, Willie D, and Bushwick Bill, with DJ Ready Red on the boards/decks was the combination that made the most impact.</p><p>Together, they crafted hits like <i><a href="http://youtu.be/IJtHdkyo0hc">Mind's Playin Tricks On Me</a>, </i>and <i><a href="http://youtu.be/24c8i_Oq8P4">The World is a Ghetto</a> – </i>to name a few.

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Geto Boys are rightfully credited with putting the south on the (hip-hop) map, and influencing a legion of artists too vast to name.</p><p>Ten years since their last album, the boys are back on tour and – if fully funded – will release a long-awaited new album.</p><p>Willie D was kind enough to take some time and discuss the history of the group, the new album and more.Interview below.</span>

<b>How did you originally become a member of the Geto Boys, because before you and Scarface joined the group, Geto Boys were already a group.</p><p>So, how did you guys get involved with them?</b>

After they had released the first album Making Trouble, which met with some original success, J. Prince wanted to take the group in a different direction.</p><p>He asked me to write a few songs for the new album.</p><p>I wrote <i><a href="https://youtu.be/_DWNsRolVdY">Let a Hoe Be a Hoe</a></i> and <i><a href="http://youtu.be/vqvvxcuugrk">Do It Like a G.O</a></i>.</p><p>They were cool with <i>Do It Like a G.O</i>, but they didn’t want to do <i>Let a Hoe Be a Hoe</i> – especially Prince Johnny C. Jukebox got over that, but ultimately he decided that he didn’t want to be in the group anymore once we actually assembled the new line up.</p><p>He made his mind up on the first day of recording.</p><p>Let me back up a little bit.</p><p>After I wrote the two songs and was given the resistance from Prince Johnny C, J. Prince came to me and asked me to join the group.</p><p>I emphatically was like, “No – I don’t want to be in a group”.</p><p>Then he was like, “Well, can you do it as a favor?" It’s like, how do you turn that down… Somebody that is so invested in your career asks you to do a favor, how do you turn it down?</p><p>So I joined the group as a favor.</p><p>I never wanted to be in the group.

<strong>That’s an incredible story.</strong>

Yeah!</p><p>That’s how I got into the group, and that night, the same night that he asked me to be in the group, he came to my house.</p><p>We stayed up for hours talking about the Geto Boys, and the direction he wanted to take the group in.</p><p>He told me about this dude Dj Akshen from the south side of town, who everyone knows now as Scarface.</p><p>He said, “I want to put him in the group, he's cold man!” I trusted Jay; I trusted his insight when it came to music.</p><p>He had a real good sense of what people liked – so I believed him.</p><p>So when he said he wanted to put him in the group, I didn’t question it.</p><p>I didn't meet Scarface until the first day that we were set to go to the studio.</p><p>He was in a van with J., Ready Red, Raheem, and Jukebox.</p><p>I met him, and about two hours later, we were in the studio writing music.

<b>Now fast forward, it’s been a long time since Geto Boys came out and it’s been almost a decade since your last album.</p><p>You guys have gone through ups and downs.</p><p>Why now?</b>

All for the fans.</p><p>Look, we can do our solo things, everybody can have a certain level of success, but there is nothing like a Geto Boys album.</p><p>There is nothing like hearing all of our three personalities, and the texture of our voices.</p><p>Each of us may address a particular topic and even though we may come from three entirely different angles, it always fits perfectly – and that's what people like about the Geto Boys.</p><p>The chemistry.</p><p>Why not now, especially considering all the things that's going on in Ferguson, the things going on in Baltimore, and everything that went on in Oakland.</p><p>I mean it's just really all over the country… The police brutality.</p><p>We saw the patrol; they're totally out of control, pushing black folks around and pushing white folks around.</p><p>They are pushing everybody around.</p><p>They are pushing anybody around they can.</p><p>Anybody sitting around defending them is constantly giving them the benefit of the doubt, and automatically jumping on their side every single incident.</p><p>Some people never give the victim the benefit of the doubt when police brutality is involved.</p><p>Cops think everything will be cool, and they will be able to do what they're doing, and go unchecked.</p><p>But that’s not going to happen forever, sooner or later the cops are going to get a taste of their own medicine – and they're going to get it in high doses.

<strong>What made you guys choose Kickstarter as a platform?</strong>

Well the biggest thing about Kickstarter, is that it allows you to cut the middlemen out of the equation.</p><p>Particularly with the message we want to put out right now; we don’t want to go back and forth with the labels about our content.</p><p>We’re about to go off, like really go off.</p><p>If you think about a lot of the music today, it’s very, very tempered.

<strong>Absolutely!</strong>

It’s very tempered, man.</p><p>It’s like People are afraid to say what they mean.</p><p>I was about to say they're scared to speak to their convictions, but many people don’t even have convictions.</p><p>Everyone wants to be friendly.</p><p>It’s cool to live in harmony and work in peace, but if peace is not an option, then I think you should set yourself to win a war.</p><p>Go to war and win.</p><p>Everybody wants to be politically correct.</p><p>You got to like everything, or somebody is trying to get your job taken away from you, or someone is attempting to assassinate your character.</p><p>Anytime you disagree with someone, what’s the first thing people say?</p><p>You’re just hating.</p><p>Since when has an opinion become hate?</p><p>People in America don’t have opinions anymore.</p><p>You can’t have an opinion.</p><p>If you have an opinion people, try to take away your life.</p><p>They just take away your living, they just take away your lifestyle.</p><p>Ostracize you, that is not cool!</p><p>So we don’t have to worry really about that.</p><p>Having endorsements and stuff like that is a bit cool, but then again, a lot of times it limits what you can say

<strong>I don’t know many labels in North America that are going to put a lot of marketing power behind a real message like that.</strong>

They're not.</p><p>There is only a tiny percentage of people who work in the majors, who love the music.</p><p>There used to be a time when people, even if they were at the top of the music chain, they had a passion for the music.</p><p>Now it seems like it’s just all about the dollar – just strictly about the dollar.</p><p>Gone are the days when labels would hold an artist and say, “the first album, if we do fifteen thousand that’s cool.</p><p>After the first album, you want to do quarter a million, and by the third album you go platinum." That’s over; now it's like "how the fuck are you going to sell a million records?"

<strong>Exactly</strong>.</p><p>It used to be a time when an album meant something, being able to go front to back just play that record on from front to back.</p><p>You can play the record and walk away you don't have to worry about it.</p><p>Now it’s as the labels are are selling up as they say “Give me a single.” And they’re putting pressure on the artists to make singles.</p><p>And the problem with a single is that it’s a just a single.</p><p>It’s not accompanied by any other compositions that hold weight.</p><p>It’s a just a single.</p><p>People don’t even know the titles of albums anymore.</p><p>They know the titles of singles.

<strong>So right now, how is your relationship, you guys in the group?</p><p>I know a lot of people feel that you guys don’t get along at all.</strong>

A lot of people are right.</p><p>We get along from time to time.</p><p>It’s just that we’ve been around each other for so long, and I do think at times we take each other for granted just like family members do.</p><p>The main reason we can make music together, and tour together, is because we do have a common denominator being that as "Geto Boys".</p><p>We understand the significance of the brand – and so we constantly come together to add to that legacy.</p><p>The thing is that as long there is no disrespect involved, I can do this.</p><p>We can have our disagreements, but disrespect will not be tolerated.</p><p>So that’s why I give the guys respect because I want my respect.</p><p>We can have our disagreements and at times, our arguments get very heated.</p><p>But as long as there is respect involved, then any differences can be worked out.

<h1>Update</h1>
Unfortunately, to the dismay of rap fans worldwide, the Geto Boys album was not fully funded.</p><p>This has left the future of the group up in the air.</p><p>Although they continue to tour, Scarface has been quite vocal about the fans being the ultimate deciding factor of the group's fate.</p><p>In an interview with HipHopDX he said the following:

<em>"In all honestly, I don't know if that's what the fans wanted," Scarface says of the group's failed Kickstarter campaign. "I feel like if that's what they wanted, then that's what we'd be doing.</em>

Disappointed fans were also quite vocal in the KickStarter's comment section – and many echoed the same sentiment: wtf?</p><p>With the number of supporters worldwide, and the amazing turnouts to theirs concerts, some point to the lack of awareness this project needed to succeed:

<em>They didn't market this well at all.</p><p>I'm a huge Geto Boy's fan, but the only reason I heard about it was a post in Facebook by Backspin on XM Radio.</p><p>I think if they step their social media game up it'd be easy.</p><p>I hope they give it another go.</p><p>I'll be in again!!!</em>

<em>Hardly anyone knew about this Kickstarter.</p><p>It's a shame, but hopefully the guys will do another album </em>some day<em>.</em>

<em>Def not happy to hear this didn't get funded.</p><p>With all those people showing up to their concerts, I'm sure if everyone backed at least $20 a head, this would easily get funded.</em>

It's a kick in the groin for fans – the same one's that Willie D described as "beating their asses" for new material.</p><p>Although not grammatically "all there", one comment sums up how a lot of us day ones are feeling:

<i style="line-height: 1.5;">Geto Boys are my ultimate favorite group.</p><p>Before Outkast and the whole southern hip hop scene came to light, there was Scarface, Willie D and Bushwick Bill.</p><p>I've followed this group since 1989 and have always been a huge admirer of this group.</p><p>Willie D always made me laugh with his humor, wit and wisdom especially on his solo projects.</p><p>Bushwick Bill the master of horrorcore, before Gangsta N.I.P. Brotha Lynch hung etc. this brother was always telling some dope stories that I enjoyed so much.</p><p>And Scarface, the master story teller, master producer and a dope artist.</p><p>When I first heard both Now I feel ya and I seen a man die.....</p><p>Wooooo!!!</p><p>I knew that this brother had a gift.</p><p>On I seen a man die, I saw this</i><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> brother as the grim reaper of thought.</p><p>Very dope!</p><p>I support these brothers and will that they make this new Geto Boys album into a reality.</p><p>I don't want anyone of them to give up, because there are alot of fans just like myself who desires to hear another Geto Boys album.</p><p>I support you brothers to the fullest and willing you so much success on all your endeavors.</p><p>Don't give up!</p><p>Peace!!</span></p></div>
