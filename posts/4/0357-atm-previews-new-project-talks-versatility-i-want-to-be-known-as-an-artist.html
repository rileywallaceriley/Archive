  <h1>atm Previews New Project & Talks Versatility: “I Want To Be Known As An Artist”</h1>
  <div class="meta">2019-04-25 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>New Jersey artist atm, the newest Mass Appeal signee, is bringing a more mellow, lo-fi aesthetic to the label’s roster which includes acts like the Starting 5, Dave East, and Black Milk.Prepping the Friday (April 26) release of his self-titled debut, he revealed to HipHopDX that the single that brought him to this point almost didn’t happen — as he had quit recording almost a year before he wrote it.“I came off like a seven month period where I didn't want to make music anymore,” say atm.</p><p>Luckily for him, that changed after he heard the instrumental for his breakout single “Rush,” which ultimately led to his current situation with Mass Appeal.“One day I was at Cor Blanco’s house.</p><p>He played the beat and I was like, ‘all right, let me try this, let me try something different.’ I wrote that song and it just came out beautiful,” he says. “I posted a snippy, I got a lot of feedback like on Twitter and Instagram ...</p><p>I just went with it.”https://youtu.be/oaKrauZ61UwSoon after, he met his manager and began shopping the record to labels, eventually landing on Nas’s imprint.“It’s more like a family label to me,” he says. “They don't just, you know, sign you and then brush you to the side.</p><p>This is really hands on — every day doing something, every week I'm in the studio,” he explains, noting that Mass Appeal has an in-house studio.“Everybody's in tune there ...</p><p>It's a real team.”An interesting element for fans is the fact that his debut on the imprint isn’t a big label affair, but rather a project he initially planned to release independently.“To be honest, I finished the whole thing before I signed.</p><p>I was waiting on it,” he says. “This is just the beginning, too.</p><p>I’m hoping this will showcase my talent and my versatility, cause I feel like I can be on a lot of different genres.</p><p>I just don't want to call it right now.“I don't want to be known as a rapper.</p><p>I want to be known as an artist.”Though he’s looking forward to touring, making clear his love of bringing music directly to the people — and the Mass Appeal machine’s ability to back it — there is an overwhelming sense that atm is about the music in a deeper way than some of the others in his current lane.As opposed to a flashy facade, he’s making honest music — and letting his output do the talking.“I like everyone to find out about me organically,” he says humbly. “I don't like to like force myself onto people.</p><p>I feel like it's more natural when it's found, you know what I mean?</p><p>You'll appreciate it more ... and hopefully, love it.”Check out atm’s debut project, below.</p></div>
