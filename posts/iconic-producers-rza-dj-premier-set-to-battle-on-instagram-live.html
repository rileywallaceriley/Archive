    <div class="content"><p>While fans await a new date for the Teddy Riley versus Kenneth “Babyface’ Edmonds battle, Swizz Beatz has announced a new matchup that's just as epic — RZA versus DJ Premier.“The paperwork is in,” Swizz wrote on Instagram.It’s a matchup that many have debated for decades. With deep catalogs that position both producers within the Top 5 of all time in the genre, fans can expect a dose of Golden Era nostalgia and (if the past battles were any indication) some interesting trivia and insightful banter.https://youtu.be/iqWm8EuzkKkCredited with masterminding Wu-Tang Clan, crafting their distinct sound and handling the bulk of the group’s releases, RZA was behind the boards of some of the most revered albums in Hip Hop history, most notably Raekwon’s groundbreaking debut Only Built 4 Cuban Linx.Outside of the Wu bubble, RZA’s expensive catalog includes solo works, projects with his group Gravediggaz and film scores/soundtracks.</p>
<p>His credits are a who’s who in Hip Hop history as well as crossover collaborators such as Travis Barker and Miley Cyrus. From music to film to books, his direct influence on the culture cannot be overstated enough.https://youtu.be/ASDOh0V1_xIDJ Premier — half of Gang Starr alongside legendary Guru — is one of the most celebrated and simultaneously imitated producers in Hip Hop.</p>
<p>His ear for loops and unmistakable scratch choruses have made him a hot commodity, even in today’s landscape.[related_article id="55252" type="news"]Preemo's legacy is etched in stone, having worked with Christina Aguilera, Common, D'Angelo, Dilated Peoples, Janet Jackson, JAY-Z, Kanye West and more recently. Griselda (to name a select few).</p>
<p>Though he’s eclectic, he remains a pillar of what some would consider to be the essence of authentic underground Hip Hop. He continues to be a vital gatekeeper who's forever championing next up rhymers and producers.It all goes down Saturday (April 11) via DJ Premier’s Instagram.</p></div>
