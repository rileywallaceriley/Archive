  <div class="content"><p>“I def  owe my love for music to my brother,” says 25-year-old Fayetteville rapper Taj (real name no gimmicks). "As a little boy, he used to ride me around and play instrumentals.</p><p>He began recording myself at 13 and --after a hiatus--released his first project titled <em>Young OG Story</em> under the stage name 365 Montana.

"<em>Young OG Story</em> showed me that it's possible for me to chase my dreams; that put the battery in my back to go hard to accomplish all of my goals."

Now renamed Taj--and with his new brand Est. 2091 brand-- his new project <em>Alienated</em> is full of jazzy hip-hop, bars heaping with progression, and a whole lot of heat.</p><p>Check it out the EP below, and if you're feeling it, knock the share button.
