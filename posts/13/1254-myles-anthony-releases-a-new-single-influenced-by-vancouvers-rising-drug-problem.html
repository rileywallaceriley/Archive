  <h1>Myles Anthony Releases A New Single Influenced by Vancouver's Rising Drug Problem</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Myles Anthony, who was featured last month for&amp;nbsp;his single with <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/myles-anthony-teams-up-with-pusha-t-for-a-new-single/">platinum-selling artist Pusha T</a>, is back with another heavy one -- his time more focused on his hometown of Vancouver, BC.</p><p>Although consistently voted one of the world's top cities to live in, the city also battles rising drug abuse.</p><p>In fact, the BC Emergency Health Services has been faced with well over 3000 OD cases this year alone; with a sizable percentage of them dying -- and 60% of those testing positive for Fentanyl.</p><p>This unprecedented rise was the catalyst for the record "Mention That (In The Couv)," which features Flintroy, Atlin and IvnTwnSnd -- over the piano-driven beat by Myles himself.</p><p>The track is has a ride out vibe to it -- ripe for a visual treatment.</p><p>It's one step closer to Anthony's upcoming full-length release, which is becoming more and more attractive with each release.</p><p>We'll continue to champion the cause and bring you the new records -- but for now, check out the track and mash the share button.
