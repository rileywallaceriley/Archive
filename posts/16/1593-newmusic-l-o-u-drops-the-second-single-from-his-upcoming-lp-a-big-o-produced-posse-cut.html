  <h1>#NewMusic: L.O.U. Drops The Second Single From His Upcoming LP — a Big O-produced Posse Cut</h1>

<p>Big O — as anyone following my musings may have come to know about the UK-based producer — stays busy.</p><p>This time around, he's connected with Jamaica Queens MC L.O.U. (who he last associated with for the poignant "The Preordained") for a new posse cut "Avenue Of The Aspects" featuring Doughboy Tony, P-Rawb, and singer Shari.</p><p>The track is the second single from his upcoming LP <em>Journey of Choices: (An Awakening Mind</em>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sewn together with a heavy-handed and oddly emotive piano pattern, the chorus-free track (which instead uses movie clips to break up verses) sees the three MCs trading verses packed with gems, reflections, and bars.</p><p>It's brimming with a motivational tome — capped off with Shari's silky vocals as the song comes to a smooth landing.</p><p>It's a vibe counter to the mainstream fodder playlisted in droves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>L.O.U.'s output hasn't been abundant in recent years — with his previous Big O-produced gem dropping last year and his previous full-length, Who Would've Known (featuring a fire Skyzoo verse) dropping about four years earlier.</p><p>Still, his prior few offerings have been exciting looks at what's to come.</p>

<p>P-Rawb has actually on a great run right now, with his latest LP with Big O, The Complexity, still getting spins just over two months after dropping.</p><p>If you've been sleeping on this gem of a project, definitely start with "Keep Mov'n" and "Dear Anthony" and work your way down the line — it's a labor of love worth getting lost in for a quick minute.</p>

<p>This is my first introduction to Doughboy Tony, but he appears to have a versatile platter; his latest single, "All Gas" — for example — is a more commercial, trappish soundscape, which he eats like cake.</p><p>During 2020, he dropped off a surprisingly satisfying EP, <em>Perspectives</em> (a five-song platter).</p><p>His vibe takes some sonic pivots from his 2019 project <em>Bigger Picture</em>, which has a decidedly more west-coast sound throughout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They sound incredible together, and as usual, O's moody aesthetic is the creative glue.</p>
