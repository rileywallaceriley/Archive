  <h1>Lil'B: King of the Internet Rappers – and Trolls</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><blockquote>"He who walks his own path of greatness will never be ancient" – Lil'B</blockquote>
Hip-hop has a bad habit of becoming habitually redundant.</p><p>I almost liken it to a series of cliques, not unlike the ones you might find in any high-school themed movie.</p><p>You have your urban-hipsters, backpackers, street rappers, new age and experimental cats and lastly the OG's.</p><p>Now arrange those all into a circle.</p><p>See that blank space in the middle?</p><p>If you can get yourself there, you win aka stand out!</p><p>Notable "middle-sitters", who inevitably become trendsetters <i>and</i> dictate the moulds of the aforementioned groups, include: Kid Cudi, Drake, MF Doom, Dilla, Tribe Called Quest and let's say – for sake of argument – Nas.</p><p>Artists in the outside circles tend be forgettable and interchangeable.</p><p>They litter both inboxes and the Daily World Star Hip Hop timeline.</p><p>Now, success is wholly subjective; I understand that.</p><p>But one artist I want to discuss is Lil'B. I'll be first to admit that he's an extremely acquired taste.</p><p>That's an understatement.</p><p>I'll also confess that I have been completely obsessed with his phenomenon – and believe me, that word was used on purpose.</p><p>He is a <i>phenomenon</i>.</p><p>Assuming my above example stands, Lil'B was in the middle and decided to walk off the field and moonwalk into the locker room.</p><p>His music is <a href="http://youtu.be/APIGP03vAz0">bafflingly bad</a> at (most) times, and yet <a href="http://youtu.be/HqYSQUHpVl8">momentarily brilliant </a>as, excuse my french, fuck at others!</p><p>It's as though he <a href="http://youtu.be/sJfBV_OQ-T4">momentarily breaks character</a>, then instantly catches himself and <a href="http://youtu.be/GOqrbTlr6SA">reverts</a>.</p><p>It's elusive like a Kanye smile at a basketball game.</p><p>Even more confusing is the disconnect between his music and his mantra of peace and love.</p><p>Especially when you watch <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">shit</span> <a href="http://youtu.be/zr9y-yh8Xt8">videos</a> like this.</p><p>In all honesty, I chocked it up to my age, as I often do when I don't understand the music of today.</p><p>The kids seemed to get it, and his following, which is <i>rabid</i>, is real the deal.</p><p>For That reason, I kept giving him the benefit of the doubt, under the assumption that I was just missing something – and you know what, I think I get it now.</p><p>Lil'B is not an idiot.</p><p>He's <a href="http://youtu.be/NPXGbLrqSGE">given multiple university lectures</a>, written a book and ultimately been – arguably – the most successful Internet rapper of all time.</p><p>He had celebrity net-worth of 1.3 million and released so much music that you literally can't fit it all into one iPhone.</p><p>Interestingly though, he hasn't released any in the past few years, and it's all been free.</p><p>This means that his appearances and lectures make up a large portion of that fortune.</p><p>He's a walking parody of everything hip-hop has become, yet he's become a symbol.</p><p>He's a living meme.</p><p>His music acts as a large billboard that reads free sex – and once you're close enough, you find a smaller sign that read free sex, next to a textbook about tolerance and self-love.</p><p>How many artists can you describe the way?</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>Hate it or love it, Lil'B spends 90% of his time connecting directly with a legion of dedicated fans, promoting nothing but positive (and often hilarious) shit.</p><p>He also regularly quotes himself and curses NBA players.</p><p>Much like 2PAC's often name dropped, yet vaguely defined, movement "Thug Life", we have to realize fully what the ultimate purpose of Lil'B's act is.</p><p>I doubt even he knows...</p><p>But it's intriguing as hell.</p><p>Hate all you want, but respect his love of what he does, and his ultimate dedication.</p><p>Peace.
