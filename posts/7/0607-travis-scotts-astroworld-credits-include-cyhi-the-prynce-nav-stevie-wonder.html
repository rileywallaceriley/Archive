  <h1>Travis Scott's "Astroworld" Credits Include CyHi The Prynce, Nav & Stevie Wonder</h1>
  <div class="meta">2018-08-03 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>New father Travis Scott dropped his highly anticipated new album Astroworld early Friday (August 3).</p><p>Now the full album credits are available, showing the host of talented names who added their touch to the offering.Even without the credits on hand, many names were already widely known, including Drake on "Sicko Mode," Frank Ocean on "Carousel," and Tame Impala, The Weeknd and Pharrell on "Skeletons."More surprising, though, were some of the writing credits.CyHi The Prynce is credited with writing on four songs: "Stargazing," "Sicko Mode," "5% Tint," and "Coffee Bean" -- though it's not immediately clear what he specifically wrote.Nav joins Gunna in the writing credits for "Yosemite," on which they both appear.</p><p>Swae Lee gets a writing credit on “R.I.P. Screw” for his feature, and Juice WRLD and Sheck Wes are both credited for their appearances on “No Bystanders.”Stevie Wonder's reps confirmed to Pitchfork that was him playing harmonica on "Stop Trying to Be God," which serves as an amazing easter egg.Production wise, Sonny Digital, Hit-Boy, Tame Impala, Boi-1da, Thundercat, and -- of course -- Mike Dean and Scott himself, among many others, helped bring this project to life.Check out the full credits for Astroworld below.1.
