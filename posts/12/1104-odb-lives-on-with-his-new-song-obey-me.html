Russell Jones, also known as Ol' Dirty Bastard, was and wasn't a lot of things.</p><p>He wasn't the most prolific writer.</p><p>It has long been known that much of his break-out debut album had been written a few years earlier by both Method Man and GZA, but who cares.</p><p>ODB wasn't a Drake-esque figure.</p><p>Nobody loved Dirty for what he said per say, but rather how he said it.</p><p>In a see of urban figures that seemed to blend, A-son was an unmistakable and unforgettable character.</p><p>He was charismatic (which is an understatement) and seemingly untameable.</p><p>ODB was cut from a cloth that many rappers have tried and failed to imitate.</p><p>From <a href=" the Grammy's</a> after losing out to Puffy, indecent exposure, or cinematic time on the lamb when he unexpectedly turned up at a Wu-Tang concert, he clearly did not give too many fucks.</p><p>And classic footage of him walking <a href=" in Brooklyn</a> and <a href=" food stamps with his family</a> in a limo is also quite revealing of his mindstate in the mid-nineties.</p><p>A more telling side, though, was seen when Dirty wasn't, pardon my French, fucked up.</p><p>Breaks in character, such as his classic unearthed interview below, reveal a man who loved his <em>many</em> children so much he damn near tears up while talking about them.</p><p>His super downplayed <a href=" doc</a> shortly before his death showed how much he loved <em>and</em> valued his family.</p><p>It also revealed his insecurities about being in jail.</p><p>Essentially, he was just a man – under all the bravado and antics.</p><p>His legacy continues to live on, in part because his fans, family, and his Wu-Tang brethren keep it alive.</p><p>Most recently, RZA and the wireless speaker company <a href="https://store.boombotix.com/products/odb-boombot-rex">Boombotix</a> have released a limited edition speaker, which contains a brand new unreleased ODB joint called <em>Obey Me</em>.</p><p>RZA officially signed on with the San Francisco-based startup last year, giving him an equity stake in the company and a hand in developing its line of rugged wireless speakers.</p><p>They originally connected through one of the speaker brand's investors, and RZA and Boombotix's VP of Marketing, Mustafa Shaikh, conceptualized and released a limited edition Wu-Tang speaker with an unreleased Wu track at the top of the year – which understandably sold out in minutes.</p><p>This latest release came about when RZA mentioned to Mustafa that he may have some unreleased Dirty material laying around the basement on the Wu-Mansion.</p><p>Just imagine having that conversation with RZA.</p><p>Well, after a month of following-up, the Abbot went into the basement and unearthed some never-before-heard bars and sent them to Mustafa. “Imagine how I felt, opening the email, pressing play and being the first person to hear this new ODB music; It was surreal,” remarked Mustafa.</p><p>Mustafa tapped his friends at Fool’s Gold Records, and had Montreal-based producers <a href="http://foolsgoldrecs.com/artists/shashu/">Shash’u</a>, and <a href="http://foolsgoldrecs.com/artists/high-klassified/">High Classified</a> produce remixes to help package the new single, <em>Obey Me</em>, like an EP. “We're acting almost like a record label,” remarked Mustafa.</p><p>Truly, it’s the most innovative way to sell a speaker ever!</p><p>He and his team have accentuated the release by holding an ODB week, which was marked by the release of the single, a <a href=" treatment</a> and a super cool <a href="https://boombotix.com/odb">app</a> that allows you to make your <a href="https://boombotix.com/odb">ODB food stamp card</a> and share it online.</p><p>The week is coming to a head with a party in NYC, which will feature good music, good people, and live art – which will depict ODB at various ages in front of birthday cakes.</p><p>ODB, always claim there was no father to his style.</p><p>It’s well put, especially as we have a hard time finding a character who came pre-dated him that even comes close to acting as an influence.</p><p>He’ll never be forgotten as long as real hip-hop still lives.</p><p>This new single is just another notch on his legacy’s belt.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether they will celebrate ODB week annually, but Mustafa notes that they do plan on releasing new music and collaborative projects in the future.

<em>Rest in peace Ol’ Dirty</em>
