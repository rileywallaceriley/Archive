  <h1>Sittin' On Chrome – 20 Years Later</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>This past weekend marked the 20th anniversary of the classic album Sittin' On Chrome by Masta Ace Incorporated – a short lived group formed by Masta Ace shortly after the release of his debut album.</p><p>To help put the album into context historically, this album dropped a year after Crooklyn Dodgers.</p><p>Ace first came to prominence with the Juice Crew in 1988 when they dropped The <i>Symphony</i>.</p><p>It's still regarded as the blueprint for a perfect posse cut.</p><p>He dropped his debut solo album in 1990, and two later formed INC.</p><p>The group itself consisted of Masta Ace, Paula Perry, Lord Digga, Leschea and&amp;nbsp;Eyceurokk. <i>Sittin On Chrome </i>was their sophomore release; their debut album <i>Slaughtahouse</i> had dropped 2 years prior.</p><p>Even though it had some serious heat rocks, like<i> I.N.C Ride</i>, <i>Born To Roll </i>and the title track, the album didn't quite "pop".</p><p>Amidst disagreements between Ace and, <i>well</i>, everyone in the group except&amp;nbsp;Leschea, the group broke up in 1996.</p><p>Ace was – for all intensive purposes – ghost until just after the turn of the century.</p><p>He dropped <i>Disposable Arts </i>and has been buzzing in the scene ever since (with a new project every 3-4 year habit).</p><p>As of late, you catch him on tour with <a href="https://twitter.com/emccrew">eMC</a> in promotion of their upcoming album.</p><p>We thought we'd take a few minutes and pay tribute to a solid piece of hip-hop history – an album that will always have a spot on my playlist.</p><p>Check out this ZULU North Radio mix.
