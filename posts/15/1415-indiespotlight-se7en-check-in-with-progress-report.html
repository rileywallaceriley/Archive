  <h1>#IndieSpotlight: Se7en Checks In With 'Progress Report'</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sun, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>This isn't the first time that Se7en Eli has <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/making-a-difference-with-music-se7en-eli/">come across my desk</a>; in the past, I wrote his song "Tango," which blends traditional Latin music with go-go, produced by a long-time collaborator and friend — who is currently doing a seven-year bid.</p><p>He's back on the scene with <a href="http://se7eneli.com"><em>Progress Report</em></a>, a complete body of work that does a good job of showing a variety of vibes from the young Emcee.</p><p>Something I didn't quite catch the first time I experienced Se7en was that his cadence was a playful blend of Logic and Kendrick Lamar — in a good way.</p><p>The nine-song release, which I bumped on Tidal, went through a series of emotions that manage to keep a pretty consistent BPM pocket, which made for a solid cover to cover as I drove around the six breaking down the songs.</p><p>Let's start with the production — which is super solid.</p><p>The soulful "Myrrh" intro, the Spanish guitar strings and chops on "Marimba Rhythm," the jazzy vibes of "421," and the slow bass of "Farewell" all make this project go.</p><p>His beat selection is on point.</p><p>Lyrically, he has bars.</p><p>It's conscious at points, and more — for lack of a better term — low-key at points.</p><p>It's not overbearing in any one zone, which makes it digestible. "Myrrh" was one song I went back to multiple times.</p><p>What seemed like a commentary on the business of "being a church," mixed with general bars on the Hip Hop industry, was a great way to open the record, and display his wordplay off the rip.

"May the doors of the church open and let us in, but somehow I still feel cleaner than the Reverend/White gloves like we are ushering in a new generation of free thinkers, they only try to stop us 'cause they know we on the brink of/Some groundbreaking..."

"421," which plays out as a hazy day-after 4.20, is full of jewels, and a smokey ambiance that Se7en rides like Chevy top down on a summer night.</p><p>While he manages to make some light references and allusions between the trap and the "daily grind" and music industry, "No Leaving The Trap" was the one song that I felt didn't quite fit.</p><p>It's still a dope track, and the guest verse from "Eazyman" is solid, but it feels like it could have been a separate single.</p><p>Though it does open up the lanes, he can traverse.</p><p>Overall,<i> Progress Report</i> feels like a literal checkpoint on where he's at.</p><p>Se7en is an artist to keep an eye on.</p><p>He's definitely on the AAHH watch list for 2017.</p><p>Early.
