<strong>Tell me about your background</strong>

I'm an artist from New Zealand.</p><p>There weren't a lot of producers in my sphere, so I mostly did jazz and acoustic gigs for my time there before I moved to the States.

<strong>How did you get into singing?
</strong>
My first performance was singing the national anthem in front of my junior school.</p><p>It was a duet that went badly wrong.</p><p>I was 11 at the time.</p><p>I felt so bad that I started working as a basketball referee to save up money for music lessons!</p><p>Took me five years of saving but when I started, my teachers helped me with finding performance opportunities and I started hanging out with older kids making drum and bass tracks.</p><p>School went downhill from there.

<strong>Who are some of your influences?</strong>

Musically: D'Angelo, MJB.</p><p>Also lyrical geniuses who put on good shows - Al Jarreau, Passion Pit...there are so many.

<strong>Can you tell me about <em>Love &amp; Light</em>, and <em>Eight Limb Yoga</em>?</strong>

I call it "yogatainment."&amp;nbsp;<em>Love and Light</em> is a play I toured CAN and US, and <em>Eight Limbs Yoga</em> is a movie I shot in India/NZ/US and is still work in progress.</p><p>They're both about how yoga has become stupidly commoditized.</p><p>I'm super protective about things that empower people to be authentic vs. retail-sex driven bogus disguised as spirituality.

<strong>You mentioned in a vlog on your YouTube that in the period when you were working to come back to America, although you felt unsettled, you remained focused on releasing an album.</p><p>What helped you maintain that focus?</strong>

I focus on doing a little bit each day.</p><p>Whether that's writing or following up with a collaborator, etc.</p><p>It's the idea of making a new opportunity each day.

<strong>Are you currently working on the album? </strong>

I've made the first three tracks &amp; vids for the EP that will be released in February, and then I'm working on more tunes to do the full album release after.</p><p>Would be cool to get some big DJs to remix the current tracks and do some more producer collabos.

<strong>What can we expect from it?</strong>

All the songs speak to "in my dreams" – hope and worry about the future.</p><p>In My Dreams comes from me honestly believing any thing's possible (like combining classical baby grand with synths and submitting to major hip hop blogs).</p><p>I know each possibility sounds like a silly dream, but I'm doing it anyway.</p><p>That's the album - big ambitions that come with a "sorry, not sorry".</p><p>Overall, though, it's a sweet sounding, a vocal driven blend of R&amp;B/pop/hip-hop.

<strong>Do you have any last words for our blog?</strong>
