  <h1>Nick Norris & DJ DN3 Release ‘How To Ruin Everything’</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Rapper and DJ/Producer DN3 have come together to create a living, breathing collection of snapshots--a collection of realness.</p><p>The two have known each other for years but never worked together until Nick was featured on an album that he produced for artist Prophetiko. "I spent about an hour in his studio when we were tracking that song, and we had good creative chemistry," Nick says. "A few months after that, we talked and decided we should do an entire record together, and I'm glad we did!"

"We didn't want the album to sound like a mere beatmaker just throwing random beats to the emcee making songs," DN3 points out.</p><p>Indeed, created throughout the course of roughly 15 months, it transcends the standard producer/emcee project with the two truly taking the time to understand the nuances of their respective roles, and melding it into a project.</p><p>It was shaped by a series of collective life experiences including  Breakups with girlfriends, national politics, local politics, etc.</p><p>Nick, for example, was going through a bitter custody battle at the beginning of the process, which he won near the projects halfway mark, which dramatically shifted his state of mind and tone.

"The record puts you on a rollercoaster," Nick describes, "one second you're laughing, and by the last track, you will have tears in your eyes."
