    <h1>Kanye West To Build “Star Wars” Inspired Low Income Housing In L.A.</h1>

    <div class="content"><p>It appears that Kanye West is attempting to marry his philanthropic spirit and love the iconic film franchise Star Wars (from an architectural standpoint).In a recent Forbes interview with Senior Entertainment Editor Zack O'Malley Greenburg, the writer describes being taken to the future site of low-income housing inspired by the structures found on Tatooine — the sparse, two-mooned home planet of the original trilogy’s protagonist.Photo: Sunset Boulevard/Corbis via Getty Images“Inspired by Luke Skywalker’s childhood home, West has been working with a team to design prefabricated structures that sport the same austere aesthetic,” Greenburg writes, describing a late-night L.A. jaunt to the site in Yeezy’s Lamborghini.He then describes being taken into the woods to see what he describes as the skeletons of wooden spaceships.“They’re the physical prototypes of his concept, each oblong and dozens of feet tall, and West leads me inside each one ... he tells me they could be used as living spaces for the homeless, perhaps sunk into the ground with light filtering in through the top.“This project is presumably the fruits of the architecture arm of Yeezy — Yeezy Home — that he describes back in May 2018, when he announced he was looking for architects.[apple_news_ad type="standard”]</p></div>
