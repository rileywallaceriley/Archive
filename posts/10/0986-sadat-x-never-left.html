  <h1>Sadat X – Never Left</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>January 20th was a big day – and not just because it was my birthday.</p><p>While a lot of heads were busy checking for the new Lupe and Joey Bada$$ albums, I was checking for my pre-order of that new Sadat X album.</p><p>Was it worth the wait?</p><p>In short, yes.</p><p>The aptly titled <em>Never Left</em>, which is X's 10 solo album, serves as a salute to the city of New York, a pound to real heads and a testament to his 25 year legacy.</p><p>The album kicks off with <em>We In New York City</em>, an ode to his hometown.</p><p>If you've never been there this track may not appeal you, but that's ok.</p><p>It's not really for you.</p><p>For some of you instantly alienated listeners the album actually begins with track 3, <em>I Know This Game</em>, where Sadat X puts the game on blast, and discusses the state of the industry, namely the degradation of the power that record labels once held.
<blockquote>"I know some A&amp;R's that now wash cars, they decided rap stars when they was in power...</p><p>Sony fired everybody, everybody sour...now rap moguls gotta blend with the locals..."
Sadat X</blockquote>
As we continue along, we come to <em>What Up Kid</em>, which is essentially cautionary words of advice to the younger generation – much like Slick Rick's <em>Hey Young World</em>.</p><p>This is one of the more serious notes on the album, as is <em>Ya Live &amp; Ya Learn</em>, which sees X discussing his past legal and marital issues: <em>"...when I went o jail I lost my wife...on that particular day I had the gun, wasn't plannin' on killing no one, I had a street beef..."</em>

Are there features, yes!</p><p>Are they crutches?</p><p>Nope.</p><p>They are prefect compliments to the vibe.</p><p>The album (most notably to me) has 16's from Black Rob (<em>Get Yours</em>), west coast legend King T (<em>Sliddin</em>'), Blacksheep/Evitan's Dres (<em>Get Right</em>) and Cormega on the already released single <em>On Fire</em>.</p><p>Also, one of my fave moments on the album, <em>Ain't Nothin Funny</em>, features Craig G and Skyzoo.</p><p>The only misstep for me was the Fokus, Nasty Ness and Chi Ali assisted <em>Put It On Me</em>.</p><p>I found the reggae flow really out of place on this album.</p><p>Overall it's an amazing listen.</p><p>A great addition was the mini story/interludes where he talks about his first show, his legendary session with B.I.G, meeting Jay-Z, seeing Nas at his shows and his relationship with 2Pac.</p><p>Aside from giving rap nerds something to talk about, they really help illustrate the influence and respect Sadat has amongst his peers in the music racket.</p><p>The album ends with the title cut, which is fitting.</p><p>Rap changed, times changed, but Sadat never changed his style or ideology for the industry.</p><p>He <em>never</em> left!
