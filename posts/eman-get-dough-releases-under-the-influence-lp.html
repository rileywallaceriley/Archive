"Once I got back into the swing of things, making music became my passion," Eman says. That drive has steadily increased in acceleration.Now, after six months of feverish promotion, Under The Influence serves as the appetizer to a string of releases coming later this year in collaboration with Freebandz Casino, the CEO of Freebandz and brother of "Mask Off" legend Future.Check out the stream, below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFIY4XK4kuk[apple_news_ad type="standard"]</p></div>
