As a preface, I'll say that the R&amp;B game is quite funny sometimes.</p><p>Things come in waves, which often leaves us with many artists who sound <i>similar</i>.</p><p>Sometimes though, you bump into a singer that has it factor – a singer on his/her plain, that writes their music and commands your attention.</p><p>Alicia Keys for example.</p><p>Some singers just keep it real and lean on pure "skills" as opposed to auto tune and commercial influence.</p><p>Now, I've been known to get obsessed with tracks on SoundCloud, and last week I lived up my reputation.</p><p>While cruising for some unsigned hype, I came across New York-based singer Laya LaRoche.</p><p>Her song<i> No Gravity</i> off of her debut album (she has two) <i>Let Them Eat Cake</i> had me stuck.</p><p>I decided to reach to and learn more about the songstress.</p><p>Check the interview below.

<strong>Can you introduce yourself to our readers?</strong>

Ayyyee, my name is Laya LaRoché.

<strong>How did you get involved in music?
</strong>
I've been singing my entire life.</p><p>My family was always involved in music and the performing arts<b>,</b> so singing and creating my songs has been something that has always come naturally to me.

<strong>Who were some of your influences coming into the game?
</strong>
Brandy has molded me in many ways.</p><p>Missy Elliot, Jasmine Sullivan, Spice Girls, Gorillaz, and most of the all black female R&amp;B groups of the 90s.</p><p>I loved the ghetto funk of 90s R&amp;B. My iPod still mostly consists of that type of music to this day.

<strong>What can you tell us about your latest project <em><a href="https://soundcloud.com/laya-laroche/sets/seraphic-nightmare">Seraphic Nightmare</a></em>?
</strong><i>
Seraphic Nightmare</i> is a moodier side of me.</p><p>I wrote most of the songs when I was quite depressed.</p><p>Even at my lowest I still experienced some moments of joy and happiness, and that's what inspired me to call the collection of these songs <i>Seraphic Nightmare</i>.</p><p>I was suffering from constant nightmares in real life at the time, and that inspired me to write songs like <i>Run</i> that later proved to be beneficial for me.</p><p>This bit of good that came out of my sorrow.</p><p>The seraphic in my nightmare.

<strong>How is it different from <a href="https://soundcloud.com/laya-laroche/sets/let-them-eat-cake"><em>Let Them Eat Cake</em></a>?
</strong>
Let Them Eat Cake was more fun and free.</p><p>It was also my first project, so I was trying to establish a style/sound of my own.</p><p>There also wasn't an overall theme.</p><p>Every track had a different vibe, but I like that.</p><p>When I had released it a lot of people told me that they were disappointed that I didn't "sing out" enough and that I was playing it safe.</p><p>I took note of this and made sure to show my vocal range and just only go off on Seraphic Nightmare which wasn't hard since it was more emotionally driven.

<strong>What's your writing/creative process like?
</strong>
I have a lot of producer friends, and I meet more everyday.</p><p>They'll send me a beat, and I'll vibe to it for a few train rides until the words come to me.</p><p>I hear the melodies first, and then the words just fall into place.</p><p>I've written most of my songs while on the train or a bus.</p><p>When I have those moments to myself while traveling through the chaos, I seem to be more in tune with my inner voice.</p><p>Weed helps too.

<strong>Think quick: Vinyl or CD?</p><p>Why?
</strong>
I'm part of the CD generation (well cassette tapes really) so I'd have to go with CD.</p><p>I can skip straight to my favorite track and put it on repeat like that (snaps finger)!</p><p>And don't forget about the cd walkmans!!</p><p>Can't carry a vinyl while listening.</p><p>I do appreciate vinyl tho.</p><p>I'd love to get vinyl copies of my projects at some point.</p><p>It's just classic.</p><p>I'd hate to see them disappear.

<strong>What's your fave album of all time?</p><p>Why?
</strong>
Daaaammnnn.</p><p>That's hard.</p><p>It's a toss up between Brandy <i>Never Say Never</i> and Gorillaz debut album.</p><p>For me, both albums were highly influential.</p><p>If I had to choose one I would have to go with Brandy, <i>Never Say Never</i>.</p><p>My mother bought me the cd for Three Kings Day when I was 8 (because we're Spanish, and we give, each other gifts on Three Kings Day).</p><p>I played the CD on repeat until it didn't work anymore.</p><p>I love every song on that album.</p><p>Her voice, the lyrics, the production, her emotion.</p><p>It was all so on point.</p><p>I still listen to it on the regular to this day.

<strong>How would you describe your live show?
</strong>
My live show is fun!</p><p>I try to have as much fun as I can.</p><p>I usually start with the turn-up records to get people going and then once I've gotten their attention I bring them into my world.</p><p>With songs like <i>Run</i>, I have a stage hand tie my hands behind my back and put a ski mask over my face.</p><p>This always makes people shut up.</p><p>As the music begins, I tell them, about the origins of the lyrics and welcome them into my world.</p><p>I don't want to give too much away.</p><p>I would like everyone to see it for themselves (shameless plug).

<strong>What are your goals as an artist?
</strong>
My goals as an artist are to bring back the music that I love and to continue creating new fusions of the music that I love – and pay my rent while doing so.</p><p>Dead ass.

<strong>What are you currently working on?
</strong>
Right now I'm putting together some new visuals.</p><p>I have plenty of singles out now that I'm dying to shoot videos for.</p><p>I've got a great team of artists and creatives that I'm super excited about working with.</p><p>I can't wait to release some new cool juice for you guys!

<strong>Do you have any last words you'd like to leave our readers with?
</strong>
Do what you want kitties!</p><p>Live your life and don't let anyone tell you how to live it!</p><p>We all have magic in us, and it's up to you how to use it.
