  <h1>Songwriter Claims Biggie’s “Hypnotize” Lyrics Were Aimed At Faith Evans Over Tupac Creeping</h1>
  <div class="meta">2019-01-18 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>In a new interview with The Art Of Dialogue, frequent Tupac collaborator and platinum-selling songwriter Delray Richardson revealed that the intended target of a mysterious subliminal on the late Notorious B.I.G's platinum-selling hit single "Hypnotize" was actually his wife, Faith Evans.https://youtu.be/wk4ftn4PArg?t=35"Dare I squeeze three at your Cherry M3, bang every MC easily," was apparently a reference to shooting at Faith's BMW M3 -- and it all stems from her alleged infidelity with Tupac.</p><p>Though Faith has long maintained that she first met Pac at Hollywood Athletic Club after being introduced by Treach, Richardson says that's not how it went down."She pulled up behind to Pac at the Hollywood Athletic Club and it was clear what I seen with my own eyes ... she and Pac had already met," Richardson explained.</p><p>He describes them having a lengthy conversation before going inside.https://youtu.be/4o24e7MnblU?t=171Biggie did poke fun at the situation on JAY-Z's "Brooklyn's Finest" rapping "If Fay' had twins, she'd probably have two Pacs." However, this new information does make it seem less as though he's reacting to "Hit Em' Up," which had dropped earlier that same month of June 1996, and more like he well aware something was up before Pac made it public.Listen to Richardson's full interview, above.</p></div>
