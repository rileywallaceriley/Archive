  <h1>Producer Sadhugold Breaks Down How "Greatminder" Ended Up On Westside Gunn's Latest LP</h1>

<p>Westside Gunn is often regarded as generous with his platform — especially as it pertains to letting otherwise slept on figures to shine on his projects.</p><p>For example, "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/77lnigsEfBkKKdWL6HsfM2?si=Qnsb1534SCCeeFIFcFSiYA">Banana Yacht</a>" on <em>Hitler Wears Hermès </em>7 was (more or less) an <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.55112/title.estee-nack-talks-learning-english-to-master-hip-hop-working-with-westside-gunn">Estee Nack</a> track.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>More recently, he put another MC on via his <em>Flygod Is An Awesome God</em> sequel.</p><p>However, he intriguingly allowed the feature's identity to remain a mystery (to those unwilling to dig for answers).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It didn't take long before some fans began to theorize that mystery voice on "Greatminder" a Sadhugold produced tribute to MF DOOM &amp; Madlib's "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/60PZUWKsJC52uXaPlPcEVf?si=S2L0oOiYS8KlejY3ShzXYg">Meat Grinder</a>" was none other than the bubbling Sadhu himself — which, as it turns out was correct.</p><p>The song was first dropped on the producer's SoundCloud two years ago to celebrate the birthday of&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/01FCoGEQ3NFWF4fHJzdiax?si=QBLq1OJOSWumL0CFYZrjmQ">MADVILLAINY</a> (DOOM and Lib's sole body of work as the duo <em>MADVILLAIN</em>).</p><p>Its original title was "greatminder (C-147)," and it sported an MF DOOM and Rick &amp; Morty mashup cover.</p>

<p>"When I first met Westside Gunn, I played that shit by mistake going through beats," Sadhu revealed to me via Twitter DM. "He was like, 'What's that?'</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"He even texted me about it weeks after that ... he stayed on my head about the track until a few weeks , when he asked for the stems."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unbeknownst to Sadhu — who produced three of the tracks on the LP — West wasn't interested in rapping on the beat at all, but instead using it in its original form.</p><p>Even more bewildering to fans, the song was released project post-release with no promotion, replacing what was previously song 12, "<a href=" Love</a>," featuring Keisha Plum.</p><p>It was an Easter Egg of epic proportions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I always thought he was gonna rap on it, but he was like, 'Nah I wanna give it wings.'"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sadhu has racked up a good number of production credits with the Griselda squad and Gunn in particular.</p><p>He first produced "SaBu" and "Stefflon Don" off of his classic LP <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7y5SAIhUDzt6JlRhHeCQVI?si=uXBHaiQwRGmnk1A-_7i_-A">Supreme Blientele</a></em>, and later crafted beats for <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7jbMpHxafUjLy1qFpykMq2?si=uoMyoBj8RliUeXdRB2VFmw">Hitler Wears Hermès 6</a></em>, <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3S5Xd1UkudsECa9D3F3NzT?si=PmUrO-c7TWC0MxHrPOUmCQ">Hitler Wears Hermès 7</a></em> and <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2JUpGYRkV6ymlDOX7UFTL7?si=I2p5zL4ZTdO8r9fjoaFsbQ">Fly God Is An Awesome God</a></em>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Still, this is the first time he's been able to get bars off on a Griselda project; and for fans of the shadowy producer, it may be the start of a beautiful thing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I've got some stuff I've been sitting on that I've always had plans to put out at the right time," he notes — sharing some snippets with me that I sincerely hope the rest of you get to hear someday. "The stars seem to be aligning."</p>
