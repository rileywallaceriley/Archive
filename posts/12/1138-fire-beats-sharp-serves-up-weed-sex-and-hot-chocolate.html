<b>How did you get into music?</b>

I started off with pause tapes, then looping and extending beats.</p><p>The Gemini 8 second sampler/mixer with a 4 Track became “The Studio." While DJing through High School, I started to get familiar with the records that were sampled.</p><p>First sat in front of an MPC3000 in 1996 – and you can say it was on from there.

<b>Who are some of your musical influences?</b>

Pete Rock, Bomb Squad, RZA, and DITC.

<b>What have you released thus far?
</b>
There’s “<a href="https://midazthebeast.bandcamp.com/album/loops">LOOPS</a>” with MidaZ The Beast, and “<a href="https://m.soundcloud.com/sharpbeats/box-of-razors-shirt">Box Of Razors</a>” with NYC artist SHIRT.</p><p>I produced the “<a href=" II</a>” remix for HUS KINGPIN's latest release #HOKTRE.</p><p>My instrumental EP “MAXIM MMXIII” along with my first Album “WEED, SEX &amp; HOT CHOCOLATE” can be found on <a href="http://lovesharp.net">LOVESHARP.net</a> and all other digital media outlets.

<b>Describe your sound.</b>

You can call it vintage, current – or, adult contemporary hip-hop.

<b>What are you currently working on?</b>

“LOOPS II” with MidaZ The Beast is about to be turned in.</p><p>I'm working on various other instrumental projects, as well as a few placements.

<b>What are your goal in the music industry?</b>

To share my music with the world and get to a point where I can help others do the same.

<b>What do you want people to take away from your music?</b>

I want them to gain a soundtrack to their life and be inspired to do everything they want, with passion.

<b>Are you looking for a deal, or would you rather be independent?</b>

Whichever will allow me to focus on creating and sharing while all the “non-creative” aspects are covered by those who do it with passion.</p><p>I have been independent, but I can see myself on a label like MellowMusicGroup or a similar situation.</p></div>
