Sounds ridiculous – but stay with me.</p><p>The project actually pulled in quite a lot of interest, but it really took off once Just Blaze pledged his commitment.</p><p>This prompted The Alchemist.</p><p>Geoff Barrow, Skywlkr, Zola Jesus, Nick Rook, Baauer, Prince Paul, Dan The Automator, Boots, and Tier Contributor Solidified Sun to also jump on the meow-wagon.</p><p>All jokes aside it sounds pretty epic.</p><p>The promo video below was posted a day ago by Mass Appeal.
