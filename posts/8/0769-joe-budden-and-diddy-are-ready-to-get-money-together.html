  <h1>Joe Budden & Diddy Are Ready To Get Money Together</h1>
  <div class="meta">2018-01-02 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Joe Budden had himself one hell of a 2017, and according to a video posted by Revolt, he’s about to have an even bigger 2018.The former host of Complex’s Everyday Struggle took a few minutes during Diddy’s lavish NYE bash in Miami to discuss his many blessings in a brief interview.</p><p>After about 23 seconds, Diddy interrupts him, getting right to business by asking, “Are you ready to get money with me?” Budden quickly responds by saying, “Are you ready to get money with me?”“Are you ready for us to put this black excellence on a whole n'other platform?” Diddy continues. “I want you to ask the hard questions.”The loose announcement comes after Budden's recent year-end special with Charlamagne Tha God, which helped to fuel a rumor that Budden had signed with Revolt for a purported $5 million, though Budden himself denied that.Fans of Budden were quick to send congratulations and reactions via Twitter upon hearing the news.In December, Budden announced that he had left Complex — and the show he helped to propel to notoriety — as the result of what he described as a corporate attempt to shortchange creatives and Hip Hop culture.</p><p>His departure was met with disappointment from fans who came to accept Everyday Struggle as a part of their daily routine and doubted the ability of the remaining two hosts to hold the show down themselves.RELATED: Five Rappers Who Could Replace Joe Budden On Everyday StruggleIt’s still unclear what exactly Budden will be doing at Revolt, but joining a roster that already includes N.O.R.E. and DJ EFN’s Drink Champs podcast seems like a positive move.</p></div>
