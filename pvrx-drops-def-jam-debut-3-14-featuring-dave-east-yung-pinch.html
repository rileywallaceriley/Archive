    <div class="content"><p>Following “Is U Down” featuring Dave East, which first dropped earlier this year, Toronto rapper/singer PVRX is back with his Def Jam Records debut 3.14.Scouted and eventually signed to the iconic imprint back in 2017, the young upstart said in a recent interview that helping usher in a new chapter for the label isn’t phasing him at all."I don't feel pressure as much as I feel motivated," he told Exclaim! Magazine. "Pyrex is meant to deal with heat."https://youtu.be/mKj7ZZC1I8AThe concise seven-song project also features California MC Yung Pinch and production credits from Bautista, Nineteen85, Akeel Henry, Moula 1st, Tay Lewis, SLMN, FrancisGotHeat and GiAngelo Power.His official major label debut came in 2018 with the viral single “Make It” — which appears on this album — followed by a standout appearance made on Undisputed, a compilation meant to showcase Def Jam’s new batch of signees.Check out the 3.14 album stream, cover art and tracklist below. 1.</p>
