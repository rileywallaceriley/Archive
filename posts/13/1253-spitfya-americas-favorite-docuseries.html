We're no strangers to Compton rapper <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/kendrick-lamar-collaborator-spitfiya-drops-a-new-trackvideo/">Spitfiya</a>; in fact, he's graced our site a few times.</p><p>The Kendrick Lamar collaborator has always come across as quasi-mysterious to us, though.</p><p>We knew he had some high-power connections somewhere, which afforded him the opportunity to be featured one of hip-hop's  best artists, but until we watched the first instalment of his new Docuseries, "America's Favorite," we didn't know the half.</p><p>The humble rapper, amidst extremely engaging visuals, tells his story -- from appearing on chart-topping albums by Flo-Rida and B.O.B, working with the likes of Will I Am, Timbaland, and Polow Da Don, all while still being out on the streets  ducking bullets and reciprocating.</p><p>It's all leading up to his opus, <i>Searching For Salvation</i>, an album that he describes as taking his whole life up to this point to create.</p><p>It's impossible not to get wrapped up in the hype after watching this video -- check it out for yourself.</p><p>Be sure to keep an eye on Spitfiya!</p><p>You heard it here first, he's about to be the next "thing" from CPT!
