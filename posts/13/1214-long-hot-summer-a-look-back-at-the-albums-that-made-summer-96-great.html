  <h1>Long Hot Summer: A Look Back At The Albums That Made Summer '96 Great</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Twenty years later, Summer 2016 stands as a pivotal period in hip-hop.</p><p>Let's set the scene -- Bill Clinton was running for re-election, VHS was still a viable format, people were still waiting for N64 to drop, EBay launched, and Donovan Baily set a world-record at the Atlanta Summer Olympics.</p><p>It was also the year that hip-hop was blessed with  can be considered as bonafide, game-changing classics.</p><p>For one, Jay-Z dropped his classic debut Reasonable Doubt.</p><p>Although at the time we couldn't have known, it stands as the rawest, most hungry -- and crucial -- project in his catalog.</p><p>He's often noted that it's the album that took his whole life up to that point to write.</p><p>It's ultimate success held Jay's future in its palms.</p><p>Had it flopped, Jay admits that he would have stuck to what he knew best, hustling.</p><p>We, of course, know how the story went.</p><p>Nas also had an album drop just over a week later.</p><p>This is more significant if you consider the  battle they engaged in roughly six years later.</p><p>It Was Written was a departure for Nas -- well, sort of.</p><p>At the time, he was criticized for lacking the emotion of Illmatic, which seems ridiculous now.</p><p>It was much more successful commercially, led by the single "If I Ruled The World," featuring Lauren Hill, whose group The Fugees had dropped their debut The Score earlier that year.</p><p>De La Soul also dropped a record that summer.</p><p>Although not as widely commercially viable as the other two previously mentioned, it was a huge turning point for the group For one, it was their first time not collaborating exclusively with Prince Paul.</p><p>The result was a much more varied sound and was the last project the group released in the 90s.</p><p>It also was one of the first major appearances of the now incomparable Mos Def.</p><p>Tribe Called Quest also held the Native Tongues down with the release of Beats, Rhymes, &amp; Life.</p><p>If their biopic rings true, the album was many things.</p><p>It was the last album where the original members all had their heart in it from cover to cover.</p><p>It was also the first time we were introduced to Consequence on the classic summer-record “Stressed Out,” featuring Faith Evans. “1nce Again” was also a big single that ruled airwaves and boomboxes.</p><p>On the south side of things, ATL duo Outkast released their critically acclaimed sophomore album, ATLiens.</p><p>A lyrical departure from their debut, the album (which has since gone double platinum) ruled the latter part of the season with the ultra-catchy slow-flow of Elevators.</p><p>Also from ATL, underground legends, UGK dropped their  Ridin’ Dirty.</p><p>With no videos or actual singles, the project remains their most successful.</p><p>Many artists, including Drake, have given it a place on their top lists.</p><p>Twenty years is a long time, and it hits home when you realize it.</p><p>We older heads are often hard to the younger generation for not being fully up on some of these classics, but they dropped a lifetime ago.</p><p>Literally.</p><p>For those of us who spent the long hot summer of 1996 chanting “Jay-Z and Biggie Smalls, nigga shit your drawers,” debating on the commercialization of hip-hop (a topic prevalent since artists like Hammer broke through), and sweating out Kani t-shirts under the blazing sun -- 1996 remains in our hearts.</p><p>Here are all of the albums mentioned — for either reminiscing or educating yourself.
