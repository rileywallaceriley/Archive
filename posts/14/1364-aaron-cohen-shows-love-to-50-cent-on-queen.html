  <h1>Aaron Cohen Shows Love to 50 Cent On 'Queen$'</h1>

  <div class="content"><p><blockquote>"Whiteboy made a wave I could ride on." --Aaron Cohen</blockquote>
While currently on tour in Europe, Aaron Cohen premiered his new single/video for "Queen$" today via Elevator Mag.</p><p>The song is produced by his go-to Kemal, as well as Calev,<a href="https://soundcloud.com/prodbycalev"> a producer I've been super into as of late</a>.</p><p>He's done stuff for Dizzy Wright, OnCue, Demrick, Emilio Rojas, to name a few.</p><p>The record is a few things; by his own description "a track about my life in Queens and also an ode to 50 Cent." The latter is obvious by the overt mentions of Fif, and the chorus' chant of "Catch you on the late night, pop shots with the fifth then slide off in the six," which is a quote from "<a href=" On The Line</a>."

The record also sees Aaron shrugging off any  comparisons to other white rappers in the game. "Not Macklemore, don't ask me that—not Mac Miller either, you'll get smacked for that." He likens himself closer to "the kid from Aftermath," lyrically.</p><p>If you haven't been following Aaron, he's been having a nice run these past six months, with premieres on all the big dog sites, and—more impresseive—his overseas tour dates.</p><p>He's across the pond now, with a headline show in Paris coming up April 7th.</p><p>Take a peek at the super dope clip, directed by FRMNDS.</p></div>
