  <h1>Kid Cubicle: Mind The Gap</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Every month, we here at Above Average Hip-Hop choose one unsigned artist to profile/review.</p><p>This month I was put on to a young brother by the name of Kid Cubicle hailing from New Jersey.</p><p>His latest release, <i>Mind The Gap</i>, hit the interwebs a month ago and really deserves some more shine.</p><p>With obvious influences from movies and English culture (among a whack of other stuff), this album has a certain thing that's hard to put my finger on.</p><p>It's introspective, lyrical, personal and extroverted all at the same time.</p><p>From the deep <span style="line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><i>Monsters in the Attic</i>, in which he discusses his battle with anxiety and hypochondriasis, to the jazzy straight-up 90's hip-hop vibe of <i>Just Getting Started, </i>it's a straight up interesting listen.</span>

<span style="line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;">We wanted to learn more about Kid Cubicle, so we sat with him and asked him a few questions.</span>

<strong>How did you get into music?</strong>

I grew up in a house with 10 people in it, so music of <i>all</i> genres was always playing.</p><p>I got into hip hop as a kid because my pops was trying to be a DJ, so he had basically every dope CD from the 90s.</p><p>As a really little kid, I'd steal all his CDs and just listen to them.</p><p>From <i>It was Writte</i>n and <i>Ready to Di</i>e to Fu Schnickens and SWV .</p><p>I got my start in music without really thinking about it.</p><p>My high school friends and I would just battle, and do shitty competitions in people's basements.</p><p>I did that throughout high school and got good enough to battle at different colleges in the North Jersey/NY area.</p><p>I joined a hip hop band 2 years after that, called the "Sly Fox Gentlemen's Club".</p><p>We did a bunch of shows in NY and were pretty awesome.</p><p>We broke up pretty quickly and I went solo.

<strong>Who are your influences?</strong>

My influences from a <i>rap</i> perspective would be: Kanye, Mos Def, Andre 3K, Eminem and Jay-Z. My biggest influence would probably be Residente from the Puerto Rican rap band named "Calle 13".</p><p>They started out as a Reggaeton band, but weren't afraid of experimenting with different sounds, and that's something I really try to strive for.</p><p>To not be afraid of doing new/different things even if it doesn't always work.</p><p>I'm influenced by all kinds of other music too, from jazz, blues, shit from the 60s, alternative and indie bands — I try to draw from all of that.</p><p>I'm also equally as influenced by movies as I am by music, so that's why I'm always making pop culture/movie references in my raps a lot of the time.</p><p>Ideally, I'd like my songs to feel like movies in your head when you listen to them.

<strong>Tell me about your new album...</p><p>How long did take to record?</p><p>What was your process like?</strong>

This album took way too fucking long to make .</p><p>I started working on it 2012, but took a break to focus on school.</p><p>I started writing the album again in London; that's where I got the idea for the title of the album <i>Mind the Gap. </i>When you take the Subway there they always say "Mind the Gap" because there's a huge gap between the train and the platform...</p><p>I guess a lot of people fall or something.</p><p>The name stuck with me.</p><p>The album wrestles with growing up, and overcoming the fear that comes along with that.</p><p>The main producer I worked with on this album was my homie Kevin Birk, who was the guy who put together that band I was in for a few months back in '09.</p><p>He's a classically trained musician who makes some fucking crazy ass beats..so good.</p><p>Sidebar: <i>Mind the Gap</i> is also a perfect album name because I used to work at the Gap  on some Kanye <i>Spaceship </i>shit.

<strong>What's up next for you?</strong>

What's next?</p><p>I'm working with a really good filmmaker from Puerto Rico to shoot a video for <i>I Don't Need to Rap</i> in a few weeks.</p><p>I'm also trying to get my grandfather in that video, which would make it the illest video ever.</p><p>Now that the record is done, I'd like to get back to doing shows in and around the NY area...</p><p>It's been a while and I'm excited to finally perform these songs that I've been locked away working on (off and on) for so long.

<strong>What are your fave albums ever?</strong>

Ahhhhhh man, that's tough!</p><p>Favorite albums ever off the top: <i>College Dropout</i>, <i>Marshall Mathers LP</i>, <i>MultiViral</i> (by Calle 13), <i>Rage Against the Machine</i>, <i>The Love Below</i>, <i>Black on Both Sides</i>, <i>The Blueprint </i>and any salsa record from Willie Colon and Hector levoe.

<strong> What's your take on the indie scene?</strong>

The indie scene is <i>everything</i> now.</p><p>I'm not even sure if there is a "major" scene anymore.</p><p>There's a crazy amount of really talented people doing awesome shit (I can't even keep track) – and (now) they actually have a shot at building audiences and reaching people, which is really cool.</p><p>I'm not one of those artists who gets mad when it seems like everyone raps now...</p><p>That's fine, I want everyone to rap!</p><p>Not <i>really</i>, but I feel like if someone is compelled to make music, rap, or any kind of art, and they do it from an authentic and real place, then I fuck with it.</p><p>I don't have to like their art or be a fan of it, but I applaud their effort, because I know it's not easy to put yourself out there.
