    <div class="content"><p>After a long winding road that included frustrating label drama, 26-year-old Brianna Perry released her long-awaited Fortune Cookie EP on Friday, December 14 -- featuring appearances by Gunna, Offset, BlocBoy JB, Ball Greezy, and more.“I feel like it’s a lot of flavors, different songs. I can’t even describe it, man.</p>
<p>You just got to listen," Perry told HipHopDX during an interview this past August when asked about the project.“Not having that big machine behind me, I went back to my roots ... I got to grow not only as an artist but as a young woman," she explained. "I just put it in my mind that I wasn’t going let the situation [with the label] stop me from chasing my dream that I had. I feel like somebody who’s followed my journey will see what hard work can get you.</p>
<p>Everybody isn’t an overnight success.”Check Brianna Perry's "Fortune Cookie," below.https://open.spotify.com/album/0UM6R2ygjqnq4rE8FsHD8y?si=c8YQOIq9TSmr6-1LWxxn2Q[apple_news_ad type="standard"]</p></div>
