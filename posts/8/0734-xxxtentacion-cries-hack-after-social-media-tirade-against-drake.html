  <h1>XXXTENTACION Cries Hack After Social Media Tirade Against Drake</h1>
  <div class="meta">2018-02-26 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>The complicated, one-sided feud between XXXTENTACION and Drake appeared to be alive and well based on a string of social media posts by the "Look At Me Know" rapper over the weekend. "If anyone tries to kill me it was @champagnepapi," he wrote in a since-deleted post. "I'm snitching RN."Shortly after, the controversial artist claimed his account had been hacked.</p><p>He told fans to disregard the incendiary posts as fakes."Please stop entertaining that bullshit on Twitter," he wrote via Instagram. "My accounts were previously hacked."X has been quite vocal about his disdain for Drake, dating back to accusations of style-biting early in X's ascent to widespread notoriety.Earlier this month, X shared his thoughts about Drake's "God's Plan" visual, claiming he influenced Drizzy with his #HelpingHandChallenge.</p><p>According to him, it appeared to be yet another instance of Drake biting.</p><p>Although giving back through charitable actions -- and encouraging others to follow suit -- is hardly a concept to which either man can directly stake a claim, X later recanted any sort of animosity for his foe.  has yet to issue any sort of response to the situation.</p></div>
