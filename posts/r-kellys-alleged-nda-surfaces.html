    <h1>R. Kelly’s Alleged NDA Surfaces</h1>
    <div class="meta">2019-01-21 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>It’s been often reported that R. Kelly made the alleged recruits into his sex cult sign a non-disclosure agreement to ensure what happens during the course of their “relationship” stays between them.</p>
<p>However, now — thanks to The Blast — we’re able to see more insight into what was laid out in the supposed NDA.As shown in the excerpts, once signed, the women became “privileged members of Robert Kelly’s team,” prohibiting them sharing any sort of confidential information about his private life, ideas, concepts, and — more broadly — any information related to his business and personal brand.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUFrAoFMtj8Aside from ensuring that women who become part of this inner circle never share anything, ever — during or after their experience with the Pied Piper — it also expanded to include their family and third-party relationships. This means that loose lips at a holiday party, or low-key remarks to the press, would render the signee legally liable for any damages.Probably one of the most problematic portions of the NDA is the curious prohibition from sharing information with anyone else who happens to be part of his “team.” That and — of course — the fact that signing apparently absolved Kelly from not only being sued, but “any and all matter of liabilities, claims, and demands of any kind or nature, whatsoever, in law or equity.” You can see more excerpts from the NDA, here.https://youtu.be/pJVxMQlKW1Q</p></div>
