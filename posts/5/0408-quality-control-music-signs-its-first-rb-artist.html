  <div class="content"><p>Quality Control Music has officially signed their first R&B artist, 20-year-old St.</p><p>Louis, Illinois, singer Layton Greene.</p><p>She first shot to viral fame in late 2017 after her remix of Kodak Black’s “Roll in Peace” began to snowball — eventually peaking at number 12 on Billboard’s Hot R&B Songs chart.“First R&B singer signed to QC, that’s major,” she wrote via Twitter. “This shit feel like a dream.”“This girl sings from her soul and we are very excited to be working with her,” QC co-founder Pierre "Pee" Thomas wrote via Instagram.In an interview with Billboard, Greene described what she hoped to bring to the game.“I hope to bring the game some new music, some integrity.</p><p>I feel like the one thing a lot of artists lack is integrity,” she explained. “I feel like they’re not honest with themselves.</p><p>We don’t get a real sense of who they are through their music.”Greene joins an already stacked roster that includes Lil Baby, City Girls, Lil Yachty, and — of course — Migos.https://youtu.be/huoQgJXLk-8</p></div>
