  <div class="content"><p><blockquote>"I don't follow trends; I barely follow friends." --Otis Clapp</blockquote>
Coming from a borough dripping with deep-rooted hip-hop history, rapper Otis Clapp is just trying to carry on tradition.</p><p>The emcee,, engineer, and producer--who's shared stages names like Chris Rock, Action Bronson, J.Cole, Ab-Soul, Mac Miller, Diplo, and Skrillex--has just under two decades in the game, and two cohesive releases under his belt.</p><p>His upcoming release Helen Keller is in the works, but to keep fans satisfied, he dropped a super dope rendition of a Wu-Tang classic, "CREAM," alongside a B-Side, "Can It Be." The dope factor--aside from Otis' bars--is the actual instrumentation; these ain't freestyles.</p><p>The beats are completely remade with a live-instrumentation feel.</p><p>After over 24k spins  on Facebook, he decided to treat fans with a visual treatment.</p><p>Otis Clapp is a dope find--and we can't wait to get our hands on Helen Keller.</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="http://www.otisclappmusic.com/">dig around his catalog</a>, and check his nod to the Wu below; happy Wu-Wednesday!
