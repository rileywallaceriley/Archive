  <h1>#IndieSpotlight: Snypes Releases Debut Mixtape</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Today an impressive album came across my desk, courtesy of Snypes.</p><p>Coming out of South Florida, his first official release <i>Rookie Debut</i> is a collection of songs with a ton of personality; there's a little of everything here, which creates a healthy balanced listen and builds a solid first impression.</p><p>Over the ten tracks, which includes an unnecessary "Panda" remix, traverses topics that range from working hard to achieve his dreams, traversing the dangers of his environment, dealing with a bunky—seemingly overbearing—relationship.</p><p>Most notably he faces down the important topic of police violence in the first single off of the project, "Terrance Tamir Bland." On the aforementioned record, he takes two perspectives, a witness speaking from a place of outrage and a victim speaking directly to the shooter.</p><p>Other standout records are "Melisa," a record that takes a hindsight perspective on a lost relationship, and the piano-driven "Don't Play" that has a ton of potential.</p><p>The super smooth "Elevator Music" is a crown jewel, though.</p><p>The syrupy-southern sound bed gives a perfect lens to use his ultra-descriptive style to drop a stack of introspective bars like, "you don't make it where I'm from with bad intentions."

Snypes had a rough upbringing, and the music was his coping mechanism; this project is a fantastic introduction to what he's all about.</p><p>He's being slept on—if you're reading this, wake up!
