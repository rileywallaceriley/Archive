  <div class="content"><p><blockquote>"What music did for me, I want to share that with people."
--Vita</blockquote>
Yonkers, New York, native Vita is one of the reasons I love writing about music; I love coming across new music from passionate artists with a story to tell.</p><p>After <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/singer-crush-nycs-own-vita-has-it/">being presented with her song "Can't Turn Away"</a> for the potential inclusion on our humble site, I did some digging and found--nothing.</p><p>The song was so dope, though.</p><p>I had to learn more about the soulful voice behind it, so I got in contact, and she graciously sat with AAHH for an interview.</p><p>Get to know the super talented up and coming singer--and the motivation behind her music--in her interview below.

<strong>How did you got involved in music?
</strong>
Well, there are videos of me—going back to when I was just little—and I was always praised for singing.</p><p>I always liked it but was told that it wasn't practical to want to be a singer, so I never took it seriously until I went through stuff later on in life.</p><p>I realized being a lawyer is just as hard  but if it's what I want to do, you have to go for it.</p><p>It's been a long ride.

<strong>What has been some of the feedback you've gotten from this new song?
</strong>
This one, I've been getting a lot of good feedback; people seem to be connecting to it on a real level.</p><p>Every song I make, I want to be able to take you to a place and be able to have you listen and relate.</p><p>I've gotten more love than I would ever have imagined, honestly.</p><p>I only have a couple of songs out, but that's because I wanted to put out the best possible stuff, and I've been writing material for a long time.</p><p>I'm working on a lot of things, but this was finally something that I was ready to drop.</p><p>I want people to sit and listen to this story that I'm about to tell.

<strong>You mentioned a project, and that was my next question.</p><p>So, what's this all leading up to?
</strong>
This  project is going to be titled <em>Aftermath</em>; I have a plan for my entire discography.</p><p>I mean, I'm sure that there will be other projects along the way, but right now I'm also working on the next project that's way under wraps.</p><p>It's been in the works for a while—so, everything is going backward in my timeline, hopefully leading up to an album that's about me growing up.</p><p>I just need to introduce myself.</p><p>I wanted to put out something that people could relate to, like the Aftermath of a relationship.</p><p>That's the idea behind this project, so it's just like me going through the motions afterward.</p><p>It's going to be a little EP; I'm going to say like four, five, maybe six songs.</p><p>That's in the works right now.

<strong>That's a good strategy.</p><p>Kanye did the same thing.</p><p>He planned out his entire discography like from day one.
</strong>
Yeah.</p><p>I've seen Kendrick talk about it doing that, too.</p><p>I want to fully explore me experiencing love for the first time, going through a real break up, and real losses—after the fact; really, the elements that built me into the person I am today.</p><p>But, I want everybody to get pieces of me before that.</p><p>Everybody needs something to relate to at the end of the day.</p><p>Every artist I love, I love them because I can relate to them.</p><p>I think you just evolve as a person, and we go through our moods and our phases and everything; each project is going to be one phase.

<strong>Ok, so Aftermath is first, what's the second 'phase'?
</strong>
The one following <em>Aftermath </em>is going to be <em>The Ride</em>, which was the relationship, and just showing how being young and in a relationship is like fighting; being the person, you're supposed to become, or subjecting yourself to your muse and just letting yourself get all wrapped in that.

<strong>I'm digging the master plan of it all...
</strong>
I'm into the whole longevity of it.</p><p>I'm not trying to push myself to make a million songs, and have some be trash.</p><p>I want people to hear what I have to say, but I want it to be quality.</p><p>I want it to be something you could listen to over and over again,even if it's something, I just throw out there.

<strong>Absolutely.</p><p>And I mean if you can do that, your fans will be way more focused.</p><p>You'll have some real fans that will grow with you.</strong>

Right.</p><p>Like, hopefully, there is a time when I'm throwing out music like that.</p><p>Like when the studio setup is correct, when I'm in the studio everyday.</p><p>When I'm just on a roll because artists go through that, I have gone through that.</p><p>If I would just release my voice memos, it would be interesting, but it's not like everything is solid.

<strong>I reached out because I wanted to get more info on you—but, was having trouble finding content.
</strong>
I've done interviews with underground radio stations—and more low-key outlets.</p><p>But, I  love to tell the story behind my music, because what music did for me, I want to share that with people.</p><p>I knew that the time would come when I'd be able to tell it.

<strong>So what was the biggest motivating factor for you wanting to  push so hard?
</strong>
One of the more significant reasons why I want people to know my name is because of my father.</p><p>He was just a real fucking person—and he went through a lot.</p><p>He did everything for his family.</p><p>As a kid, he never talked to me like I was just a kid; he always valued that I am a person.</p><p>He taught me that even though I'm a woman, I could be tough and achieve anything.</p><p>I want to sing his story.</p><p>Because when you leave, you don't realize there might not be anything to be said about you, and that would be a shame if his story weren't heard, so I partly do this to keep his name on.</p><p>I came from a dark place, and I know that it would kill him to see me in a dark place.

<strong>I mean, the power of it too is, there might be a lot of other people that feel the same way, or are in a similar situation.
</strong>
Right, and not even that.</p><p>I remember the music I was listening to when he passed away; I guess that's why I relate to hip hop.</p><p>I grew up in Yonkers, and I had a great upbringing.</p><p>My family never really struggled, and if they did, they didn't let me know about it, you know what I mean?</p><p>I don't know, I just feel like I'm not the typical story, and even though I'm from the suburbs, I'm sitting here listening to Biggie and feeling something.</p><p>I just always connected with music, and I always appreciated hearing things I needed to hear.</p><p>You ever have like a song that comes on, and you're like, 'shit, I needed to hear that today?' That's what I want my music to do.</p><p>Whether it's a good vibe, or it's some real emotional shit, I just want people to feel like, 'I needed that.'

<strong>At the end of the day, ultimately, what's your goal?
</strong>
I want to one day be touring and have people want to know all the words to my songs and look me up on genius, and things like that.</p><p>I was that person waiting for that next drop, waiting for the album from somebody, just so that I could get in my car, put it on, sit back, roll a joint, smoke it, and let everything else--whatever's going on--just go away.</p><p>I just want my music to be that; for some music is just something that they have on in the background, but for me, it's like my mind is constantly on it, and I mark my memories through the music.</p><p>So, if someone can mark their memories with my music, I'd be a happy person.
