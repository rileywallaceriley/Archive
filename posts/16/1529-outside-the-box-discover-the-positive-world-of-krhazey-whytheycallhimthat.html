  <h1>Outside The Box: Discover The Positive World Of Krhazey Whytheycallhimthat</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Every once in a while you come across an artist who falls outside the box of industry convention; by that I — of course — an artist who doesn’t seem motivated by the basics that have poisoned the soul of the culture.</p><p>An artist that puts his music first.</p><p>Brooklyn MC Krhazey Whytheycallhimthat is one of those artists. “A positive change in consciousness has the power to topple barriers almost as easy as a negative change creates them,” he tells AAHH describing his mantra for creating.</p><p>If that doesn’t create an immediate sense of urgency for his music, then I don’t know what to tell you.</p><p>Off the bat, there is something endearing about his admirable need for not only a purpose but to give back.</p><p>Early on in his career, he began volunteering his time — and his unique brand of Hip Hop to the 25-year-old Art Start.</p><p>The program dedicates itself to New York City’s underserved youth, delivering consistent creative workshops inside homeless shelters, alternative to incarceration programs, and partnering youth agencies.

“The program gave me a sense of direction, understanding and a hope for change; real change in myself and my environment,” he says.

What I find so cool about his music is the way that it all seems to contrast and compliment itself at the same time.</p><p>His latest joints are a great example. “Jack Frost” for example has this bouncy ballad behind it, paired with these haunting lyrics that have this almost literal intention of describing this cold-heartedness developed though...well...life.</p><p>Then there’s “23:5,” which has this almost “Marvin’s Room” feel to it — complete with a call to his ex.</p><p>But it spirals into this realization that the liquor is a crutch, followed an aggressive assertion of the path before him.</p><p>Then the vibe of his latest “Makeda” is a pseudo-love track with hella depth, and again a completely different vibe.</p><p>Everything I hear from this kid I like.</p><p>Even going back to the summer, with his super dope single/video “BTD,” with it’s kind of goofy visual concept.

Without being driven by the same old, his music has this certain unspoken originality to it.</p><p>Even the fact that he rocks an anime-inspired kung-fu headband ends up coming across like DOOM’s mask in a sense.</p><p>It’s hard not to get into.</p><p>And the spirit of giving back, which inspired him to start his own foundation — Young Heroes Undefeated — is an added layer that makes you want to root for him. “We make original comic books for children with special needs and use the profits to send the kids and their families on all expense paid vacations,” he explains of the foundation’s mission.</p><p>With a four comic series being released next year — on top of a solo LP and a project from my his Audio Temple — there is a lot to look forward to here.</p><p>He’ll be launching a kickstarter for his foundation in coming weeks; stay tuned to our Instagram for details on how to support something positive.</p></div>
