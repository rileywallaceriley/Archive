  <h1>#IndieSpotlight: F.A.A.N.A.N. – Contradiction</h1>

  <div class="content"><p><blockquote>"Eminem's style was so free and I always wanted to have that in my music.</p><p>I liked 50 cent's arrogance.</p><p>Then you have the conscious types like Kendrick and J.Cole…I incorporate all of that in my music."
--F.A.A.N.A.N.</blockquote>
F.A.A.N.A.N. -- an acronym that means Forever ABOVE the Average, Never Ask for Nothing -- is a 26-year-old artist from Ensley, which is one of the roughest parts in Birmingham, Alabama.</p><p>A self-described laid-back guy, he tends to describe his sound as backpack, as opposed to trap or gangster hip-hop.</p><p>People who know him say he rolls down a similar lane as Wale, Chance Tha Rapper, Childish Gambino.</p><p>How can you not be intrigued?</p><p>His latest release, <em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/contradiction-feat.-quentinsounds/id1128310114">Contradiction</a></em>, is interesting because it seems like an apparent contradiction to his personal description of himself, whether he meant it to be or not; it's anything but straightforward.</p><p>While it has some classic hip-hop songs/elements intertwined throughout the thirteen tracks, there is also some sexy radio-ready R&amp;B, a few moments that border on neo-soul, some southern vibes, and -- of course -- some of the bassy braggadocious sounds of the day.</p><p>There isn't much filler on this LP, and it seems well paced and produced.</p><p>He proves himself as a lyricist off the rip, with the horn-filled intro, "True 2 Me," which actively positions his skill level, and depth of socio-political awareness.</p><p>He starts to seemingly switch up focus over the next few tracks, from the 'things won't change' themed "<a href="https://soundcloud.com/f-a-a-n-a-n/never-quit">Never Quit</a>," to the focused female records that follow .</p><p>That's not a bad thing, though. "Pick Up," and "New Things," are two of <em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/contradiction-feat.-quentinsounds/id1128310114">Contradiction's</a></em> highlight . "New Things" actually puts me in the mind of "Marvin's Room" by The 6 God, Drake, from his Sophomore release.</p><p>The project -- lyrically -- is full of truths, experience, and soulful, glimmering positivity.</p><p>The must-listens here are the soulful "Feels Good," the jazzy "Golden," and the "Bumpy's Lament" sampled "Playing In The Wind."

<em>"I want people to see the hard work I put into every song I make.</p><p>Every work you hear on my song I wrote and came up with myself.</p><p>Even if I have a singer featuring, I wrote the melodies and the words.</p><p>I put a lot of time into making sure I am competitive with those already in the industry because I don't feel that being unsigned is an excuse.</p><p>I want people the listen to my music and hear the lyrics and understand that you can have a conscious rapper and still enjoy the music at the same time." 
—F.A.A.N.A.N.</em>

F.A.A.N.A.N.'s <em>Contradiction</em>  seems incredibly well put together, well produced, and well packaged.</p><p>You'll wonder why he isn't much bigger; well, the music industry is a crazy place.</p><p>He sounds like he's one chance meeting or good look away from the next-level.</p><p>Somebody sign this kid, ASAP.</p><p>Head over to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/contradiction-feat.-quentinsounds/id1128310114">Apple Music to stream/buy the LP</a>.</p><p>Early</p></div>
