  <h1>#IndieSpotlight: Will EQ – Dark Years (Interview)</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Hip-hop -- as a vehicle capable of social change -- often comes down to a series of cosigns, which is understandable in a sea of millions of voices struggling to be heard.</p><p>Well, 30-year-old emcee Will EQ has that covered.</p><p>A ride through his audibly scenic SoundCloud, features alongside the massively successful rapper/producer David Banner, and 2016 XXL Freshman Dave East is sure to grab your attention; at the very least, it makes Will seem connected in the industry.</p><p>Don't get lost in the weeds, though.</p><p>His <a href="https://exit.sc/?url=http%3A%2F%2Finstagram.com%2Fwilleq">Instagram  album  <i>Dark Years</i></a> is innovative for a lot of reasons -- and a solid bridge to his upcoming release, which he describes as more bright and uplifting; like a light after the dark.</p><p>Dope right?</p><p>Well, Will EQ took some time out from his grind to answer some questions for AAHIPHOP -- check out his interview below.

<i>So, what are you all about?</i>

I am about uplifting my community, and music is an outlet for me to "reach out and touch people" verbally. 

<b>How would you describe your music?</b>

The sound is a conscious southern sound.</p><p>Others have compared it to a modern day Outkast type sound or a southern Kanye sound. 

<b>How did you get in the game?</p><p>What are you working on?</b>

I have been involved in music all my life.</p><p>Many members of my family are musicians and producers (including Nitti Beatz).</p><p>I also have ghostwritten for various artists - but I prefer not to go into detail about that.</p><p>My influences are Outkast, Jay-Z, Nas, Killer Mike and a Tribe Called Quest.</p><p>I have a record out with Dave East and another with David Banner.</p><p>I am about to drop a longer version of the Dark Years mixtape and then my EP in the fall called Light Years.

<b>How did you link Dave East?</b>

Dave East came about because my manager had connected with his manager.</p><p>We wound up doing a great record together called "Started In The Hooptie." That guy is uber talented.

<b>How about Dave Banner?</p><p>He's a genius...</b>

Yes, David Banner is a genius.</p><p>It was an honor working with him.</p><p>My cousin Nitti Beatz connected us (and produced the song) - "Mu Fucka".

<b>What would you consider a huge achievement in your career?</b>

I measure achievements differently, so to me the biggest achievements when fans quote my lines because they have a deep connection with the meaning(s).

<b>What was the concept behind <i>Dark Years</i>?</b>

The concept behind <i>Dark Years</i> was to give ppl a sample of the new material I am working on - which organically was coming out dark.</p><p>The plan was to drop videos of the material on Instagram - and make it the first IG mixtape.</p><p>Just wanted to be innovative and creative.</p><p>However, I also plan on releasing a full version of the project (i.e. full songs - as opposed to the 1 minute IG videos) next month.</p><p>The follow-up, <i>Light Years</i>, will be a collection of "brighter," more uplifting songs.

<b>What is your goal, ultimately?</b>

My main goal as an artist is to reach and connect with as many fans as possible - to give them music with a message that they can still jam to.</p><p>I'm increasing my ability to uplift and strengthen my community and people in general.</p><p>So if music allows me to do that, then that is my "come up."</p></div>
