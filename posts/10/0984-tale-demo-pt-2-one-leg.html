  <div class="content"><p>Welcome to part 2 of <em>Tale Of The Demo</em>.</p><p>This week we're going to feature One Leg Up Records, who have pressed some amazing demo releases.</p><p>What makes these releases even more awesome are the limited nature of them (roughly 200 each).</p><p>Some of their most notable releases to date have been Herb McGruff's <em>Demo EP</em>, Beatnuts <em>Intoxicated Demos</em>, Pete Rock &amp; CL Smooth <em>The Basement Demo</em>s and Lord Digga's <em>The High Plains Drifter EP</em>.</p><p>They also released a highly praised Brand Nubian EP, which was a demo recorded just before <em>All For One</em>.</p><p>Something about hearing these demos on vinyl makes it even that more <em>special</em> for real heads.</p><p>Unfortunately if you're reading this, you missed out – however you may still be able to find yourself a copy on discogs.</p><p>If having it on vinyl isn't a priority, the bulk of One Leg Up's releases can be found on Spotify, You-Tube and so on.</p><p>We compiled some stand-outs below!
