  <h1>New Jean Grae EP "#5"</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Back in 2008, amidst an announcement that she would be retiring, Talib Kweli urged fans to buy Jean Grae’s album, even proclaiming her "<em>one of the last true MCs left.</em>” Jean Grae has been dropping bombs on wax since she was discovered in 1996.</p><p>Since then she’s dropped, amongst other things,  6+ solo releases.</p><p>She’s worked with true school royalty in the industry – we’re talking everyone from Styles P to Master Ace (shit she even worked with Lil'B).</p><p>With the co-signs Talib Kweli's and from producers like 9th Wonder, you always know you’re getting a quality product from Ms.</p><p>Grae.</p><p>Jean has been dropping EP’s on her <a href="https://jeangrae.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a> over the past few years, and this week she blesses us with her latest, aptly titled <em><a href="https://jeangrae.bandcamp.com/">#5</a></em>, because it’s literally the fifth one.</p><p>This one is different though – the every sharp emcee changes things up and delivers five tracks of singing.</p><p>With a neo-soul vibe, Jean drops dope material with an eerily Badu-ish vibe on tracks like <em>So Glad It’s Over</em> and <em>SFSC</em>.</p><p>If you're a Jean Grae fan, this is a <em>must listen</em>.</p><p>Check it out after the jump.
