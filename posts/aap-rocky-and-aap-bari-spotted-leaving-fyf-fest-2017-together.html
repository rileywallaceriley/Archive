    <h1>A$AP Rocky & A$AP Bari Spotted Leaving FYF Fest 2017 Together</h1>
    <div class="meta">2017-07-24 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>A$AP Rocky and A$AP Bari were spotted leaving Los Angeles' FYF Fest 2017 together in Rocky's white Ferrari over the weekend, suggesting the Mob's starting quarterback, Rocky, is standing behind Bari — the man who initially introduced him to the late A$AP Yams and kickstarted his career.Bari was accused of sexual assault after a disturbing video came to light earlier this month. The A$AP Mob members' reunion comes a week after Rocky possibly took a shot at Bari during his set at the Agenda trade show and concert in Long Beach, California, where he amended the lyrics of "Telephone Calls" to call Bari a "bitch."Since then, there's been no additional public response from the Mob — aside from Playboi Carti's public condemning last week — and Bari has yet to say anything further after his official statement.</p>
<p>It's likely the reconciliation happened offline at some point over the last week.FYF Festival 2017 featured amazing performances from artists like A Tribe Called Quest, Erykah Badu, Missy, and Frank Ocean who brought out actor Brad Pitt.</p></div>
