The Canadian music scene has come a long way – and that’s no exaggeration.</p><p>Artists like Drake and P.Reign are repping the city of Toronto globally, much to the chagrin of many World Star Hip-Hop trolls.</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, the hip-hop scene in the city has been thriving since, well, <a href=" Few artists have stood the test of time better than rapper and producer Saukrates, a member of the famed Circle crew, which includes the likes of Kardinal Offishall, amongst others.

He’s been around the scene, and then some.</p><p>His gold, award-winning debut album featured Common, Heltah Skeltah, Xzibit and more.</p><p>He’s a member of Redman’s Gilla House camp and was once signed to Def Jam records.</p><p>He’s produced music for the likes of <a href=" and performed on stages across the nation – and across the border.</p><p>He’s a seasoned, well-respected vet, and he was kind enough to chat with me about his career, his latest project, <i>Amani,</i> and more.</p><p>Check the interview below.

<strong>Let’s talk about how you got into hip-hop.</strong>

I think all of us started out as fans you know – just fans of hip hop.</p><p>I think maybe around maybe ’86-’87, when LL, Rakim, EPMD, and Big Daddy Kane came out is when I locked in.</p><p>I already had an interest in the arts, because I grew up playing classical violin, so I <em>always</em> had an interest in performing music.</p><p>Me and my next door neighbour Lock Jaw, who is featured on the B-side of my first single called <em><a href=" Caught Up;</a> W</em>e used just to freestyle on the basketball court, and then one day we decided just to write it all down.</p><p>I took it seriously when I got an opportunity at a summer program called <a href="http://metronews.ca/voices/backstage-pass/376360/get-schooled-in-chapter-of-toronto-hip-hop-arts-history/">Fresh Arts</a>.</p><p>That’s where I met Kardinal Offishall, Jully Black, Marvel, Solitaire, Win-K – basically the whole beginning of the Circle Crew.</p><p>That’s how I got started.

<strong>Looking at <em><a href=" Underground Tapes</a></em> – that album was crazy ahead of its time.</p><p>It had OC on it, Common, Pharoahe Monch, Xzibit…do you think you got the respect you deserved off that album?</strong>

I do think I got the respect I deserved off that album.</p><p>Meaning to say that I went gold in Canada – and gold back then meant you had to do 50,000+.</p><p>We got nominated for a Juno, got nominated for a couple <img class="CToWUd a6T alignleft" tabindex="0" src="https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/vUqRl6i_DDxteifmZjuWzHGCUfpFKmJ897xC7DCgkVGVJYq5V7_2Ex_Kkf8hzSIZLnozVxlAh5nLzoTvAfroZsEt6gCvSbu26RGFROOycjlVHUxIYDbc=s0-d-e1-ft#http://respecta.net/uploads/posts/2009-11/1257561651_frontpk6.jpg" alt="Saukrates" width="276" height="292" />

<span class="im">of MMVA’s, toured across the country, and even got some US radio play.</p><p>Also, the quality of the music has lasted the test of time – like I never stop hearing about that album.</p><p>I think that’s the most important thing to be said about that album.</p><p>It’s the fact that <em>everything</em> that was done at that time hadn’t been done before by a Canadian MC or producer.</p><p>So it broke ground and let a lot of cats know that we can do it.</p><p>You know what I mean?</p><p>It was a motivational piece, and we got a few cool surprises too like <i>Money Or Love</i> landed on the <em>Boiler Room Soundtrack</em> for example. </span>My friend and brother from another mother, Mick Karen (he’s now head of A&amp;R at Warner Music) helped put out the underground tapes in the US.</p><p>We did an alternate cover in Canada.</p><p>You know the American cover of the underground tapes, the comic book cover? <a href="https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCkQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmikeshinoda.com%2F&amp;ei=R7kmVZWdGIWTsAWCpYHgAg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFw6-dVM09XbRNptDC8tZzTfPef3g&amp;sig2=Q50nR9oxqlvEqwErYtGm6g">Mike Shinoda</a> did that.</p><p>He did that like three years before Linkin Park blew up.</p><p>So that record just helped do so many things, on so many levels.</p><p>I still do off a lot of those songs; people request them.</p><p>It also got me signed to Def Jam!</p><p>Once we put that out, and Redman heard <em>Money Or Love</em>, I was on a plane a few days later.</p><p>It’s amazing how some music can stretch over your lifetime and keep coming back.</p><p>I think that’s what keeps Paul MaCartney going .

<strong>What’s your take on the Canadian scene?</strong>

It has changed a lot, but as much as it’s changed it’s stayed the same.</p><p>For instance, there have always been hungry MCs out there, and it’s just more popular now.</p><p>I mean, the internet has changed everything for all lines of business and not just music.</p><p>So, with that being said the Toronto scene has been able to grow (exponentially) without the help of major labels, which is how we  used to operate in the past.</p><p>It almost seems as though it’s come full circle, but there is <em>more</em> exposure now for people who didn’t necessarily have a voice before.</p><p>Now it is like, you can post something, shoot it with your camera and if it is quality people will find you.

<strong>Let’s talk about your latest release <a href="http://smarturl.it/BUYAMANI"><em>Amani</em></a>.</strong>

Well, for me it’s a breath of fresh air, and another opportunity to put out music under the name Saukrates as an emcee because I’m also a producer.</p><p>The quality of the music is so high – it feels like I’ve come full circle as I went back to the roots.</p><p>I'm delivering what people expect from the Saukrates brand.</p><p>I call it the cool box, like you know when people say don’t put me in a box?</p><p>Well, I don’t mind being in <em>this</em> box if all I got to do is do what I did in the beginning.</p><p>So it’s a breath of air for me because it is right back to the basics, and I’ve learnt so since I was seventeen years old, so the lyrics to me feel even more potent.</p><p>We’re having a good time with it, and the recognition is coming back, it’s like <i>wow</i>.</p><p>It’s like the Dr Dre phase.</p><p>You know, I looked up to him and Quincy Jones, and the way they can stay quiet, disappear, then come back like <em>nothing</em> had changed and that’s what this <a href="http://smarturl.it/BUYAMANI"><em>Amani</em> EP</a> represents for me.</p><p>It’s only the first installation in the Season Two campaign.

<strong>What’s going to be the next installment?</strong>
<div class="adL">

Well, the next instalment we did was a double-sided single, <a href=" and <em>Elixer</em>.</p><p>The second chapter is on its way .</p><p>The features on it are great – Sonreal is back.</p><p>I always got to call on Kardi, we always find a way to make it work for each other, and you know, we got other producers coming in, carrying the load with me.

<strong>Are you still connected with Gilla House?</strong>

Yep!</p><p>Redman is more of a big brother to me than a business associates.</p><p>So, even as Def Jam faded for us, Redman and I maintained a family connection – and we genuinely care for each other’s careers.</p><p>So, we share music, talk shit, and when he comes around, he stays at my home with my family.</p><p>He hangs with my wife, my son and I,  just having a good time.</p><p>Gilla House connections that will never go away, we’re a family first!
