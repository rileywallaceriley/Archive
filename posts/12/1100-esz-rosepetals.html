  <h1>EsZ – RosePetals</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Hip-hop is an art form, much like painting, with many of it's disciples creating lustrous portraits of gritty, everyday reality – sans smock and paint brush of course.</p><p>Some (music) artists, though, see the parallel between the fussy, detail oriented expression of fine art, and hip-hop, and strive to create intersections between it.</p><p>New York-based artist EsZ is one such artist.</p><p>His latest piece, <i>RosePetals</i> is a very vivid story of a young man trying to break a young woman – who has been through pain/heartache – out of her shell.</p><p>He cleverly describes this as letting her show him the "hues inside her colourful mind." It's all about the bars!</p><p>Give this young man a spin!
