  <h1>#IndieSpotlight: Xleoniduz Is Back With Some Big Tracks</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I've covered Miami rapper <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/miami-fresh-introducing-xleoniduz/">Xleoniduz </a>quite a few times now, and he manages to change his vibe and aesthetic quite seamlessly; whether it's the <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/miami-rapper-xleoniduz-drops-two-new-records/">introspective lamenting of a one-time trapper</a> or <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/xleoniduz-takes-us-on-a-trip-to-versace-mansion/">ambient audio-art</a>, he traverses numerous styles without missing a beat.</p><p>Hsi latest batch of records are slower, jazzy, and a perfect soundtrack to the end of summer.</p><p>It's safe to say they are odes to his love of women. "P.A.P.I." which has been floating for just over a month has already amassed almost 39k spins on SoundCloud, which it's infectious hook that reminds (only conceptually_ of the Ludacris/Nate Dogg classic "Area Codes." On "Girls" he breaks down the flavors of girls he's feeling over the smoothest instrumental I've heard in a while.

The saxophone fueled "Mi Negra" is a subtle warning to stay the hell away from his girl; the track is a head nodding ode to love.</p><p>What I've always admired about Xleoniduz is that when he hits me with a pack of records, they all seem to have a cohesive feel.</p><p>Right down to the cover art, which is super dope, he is a complete package.</p><p>These latest tracks are the strongest I've heard from him and seem to ooze the most commercial appeal thus far, in my humble opinion.</p><p>Give the new tracks a spin, and sty up on the kid!</p><p>Early.
