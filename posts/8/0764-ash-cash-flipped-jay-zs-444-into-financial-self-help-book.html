  <div class="meta">2018-01-08 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>JAY-Z's critically acclaimed 4:44 -- one of HipHopDX's Best Rap Albums of 2017 -- was a career revelation, displaying the clarity he's gained as a father and husband.</p><p>However, as shown in the new book The Wake Up Call: Financial Inspiration Learned from 4:44 + A Step by Step Guide on How to Implement Each Financial Principle, the album is much more than that.Author, radio host, personal finance expert and celebrity life coach Ash Exantus -- better known as Ash Cash -- decoded the plethora of financial jewels within the album and created a step-by-step blueprint for building and leveraging credit, starting a business, investing money wisely and much more.https://youtu.be/RM7lw0Ovzq0?t=2m28s"My inspiration for the book was that JAY was giving so much knowledge about how you can become financially free ... as an individual as well as how we (as a culture) can break the cycle of poverty in our community," Cash explained to HipHopDX. "Because some of the concepts may be new to some of us, I wanted to expound more on the blueprint that JAY gave us (pun intended).</p><p>In essence, JAY gave us the 'what.' My goal with the book was to give the 'how.'"As the author explained, Hip Hop -- as a platform -- has always been a teaching tool from its inception, especially as it relates to financial health."Busta Rhymes was telling us to 'floss a little, invest up in a mutual fund' and Quavo is telling us how to invest our money wisely when he says, 'You get the bag and fumble it, I get the bag and flip it and tumble it,'" Cash notes. "Our music can take a serious and scary topic like finance and help us to learn the lessons we were never taught."In the words of Mr.</p><p>Shawn Carter, "Fuck rich!</p><p>Let's get wealthy!</p><p>Who else gon' feed we," Cash says.The Wake Up Call: Financial Inspiration Learned from 4:44 + A Step by Step Guide on How to Implement Each Financial Principle is available here.</p></div>
