  <h1>XVRHLDY: The New Sound Of Chi-Town</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><p class="p1">Chicago is indeed a bright, vibrant hub of music.</p><p>The city has birthed careers of greats ranging from Curtis Mayfield and Chaka Khan, to R.Kelly, Common and Kanye West.</p><p>It's also, as of late, become the nucleus of the drill movement, which has been led by artists like Chief Keef, Lil' Herb and Lil' Durk.</p><p>It's the definition of musical melting pot.</p>
<p class="p1"><!--more-->Enter <a href="http://xvrhldy.tumblr.com/">XVRHLDY</a> (pronounced Xavier Holliday), the new face and sound of the Chicago music scene.</p><p>With a vocal range that (sonically) makes us think of a young 3 Stacks (Andre 3000), Xavier is bringing a unique style/sound – and it's not going unnoticed.</p><p>He was recently featured by big publications like The Source and XXL, and the list goes on.</p><p>His highly anticipated <em>Need To Know II: LUNA</em>, dropping early 2015, will feature the likes of Pete Rock, Saba, NoName Gypsy, Joey Purp and Odd Couple, among others.</p>
<p class="p1">We took some time out to chat with <a href="http://xvrhldy.tumblr.com/">Xavier</a> (interview below).</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>Tell us about how you got into hip-hip</strong></p>
<p class="p1">I've been performing since I was young – my mother used to make me memorize long speeches, like 6 pages, and recite them in front of large crowds of people at church functions.</p><p>So I've always been comfortable in front of an audience.</p>
<p class="p1">As far as hip-hop goes, I actually didn't grow up listening to it.</p><p>When I was younger, I was more more into punk rock – Panic At The Disco, Fall Out Boy, All American Rejects (etc).</p><p>The first rap I ever really heard was Beastie Boys, <a href=" To Ill</em></a>.</p><p>I actually had that on cassette tape.</p><p>That's where it started for me, I started writing raps and poems and it grew from there.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Tell us about your music.</p><p>Who are some of your influences?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">I don't like to really give influences, because I feel like I don't fashion myself to sound like anybody – but in terms of the actual sound of my voice, I've been told I sound like André (3000) a lot, just as far as the southern drawl we both have.</p><p>As far as actual influences, I pull most of my inspiration from my life and what I go through rather than from an artist.</p><p>From my abstract thoughts.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Walk us through your current projects.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">I have a few older projects, from before I was as serious as I am now, but I'd say my most important project to date has been my <a href="http://xvrhldy.tumblr.com/post/75616425756/download-need-to-know"><em>Need To Know</em> EP</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">I originally wanted to make a whole album.</p><p>I was living in NYC at the time and my circle there (including my producer), after hearing the sounds I was making, told me not to waste them.</p><p>Rather, that I should release them properly – hence the EP.</p><p>That was really something that I released to hold my fans over while I fine tune the album.</p><p>Crazy thing about that project is that it was written and recorded in 3 weeks, but it doesn't at all sound rushed.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Right now your getting a lot of attention from the industry.</p><p>How does that feel?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">It really inspires me to keep going.</p><p>People don't always get to see the work you put in you know?</p><p>It's like studying for school finals; nobody really sees the effort you put in at home, just the overall performance in the exam.</p><p>It's inspiring that people are noticing what my vision is and what I've been working on.</p><p>It feels hella good, and I'm going to just keep pushing.</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>What are you working on now?</p><p>Do you have an album coming?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">I actually have two projects coming soon.</p><p>One is a shorter project, which is actually a sequel to Need To Know –<em>Need To Know II: LUNA –</em>that's actually finished now.</p><p>It's just being mixed.</p><p>I plan on dropping another video before that too.</p><p>As well, l'm working on making sure the album sounds the way I want it to sound.</p><p>That should be out in the summer.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>We're looking forward to that!</p><p>Any last words for our blog?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">I appreciate you interviewing me!</p><p>I'm in a particularly good mood today, I'm at Starbucks drinking the white cocoa – and I <em>love</em> the white cocoa! <strong>I'm in love the cocoa</strong> man, the <em>white</em> cocoa!</p>
