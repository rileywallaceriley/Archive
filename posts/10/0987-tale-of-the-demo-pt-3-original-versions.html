  <h1>Tale Of The Demo Pt 3: Original Versions</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I'm a junky for original versions.</p><p>It's not often that you find a classic hip-hop record that didn't have an alternate version – for a multitude of reasons.</p><p>It could be that once they had money they could afford better production to spruce the track up.</p><p>It could be a matter of sample clearance, like Kanye's <em>All Falls Down</em> that originally featured a Lauren Hill sample; however, more often than not, the original just wasn't hitting,  so once signed, the label took the steps necessary to make the track sound its best.</p><p>This week we look at three originals and judge for ourselves.

<strong>Camp-Lo - <em>Coolie High</em></strong>

Camp-Lo's Uptown Saturday Night was a sleeper hit – a musical cult-classic of you will.</p><p>Led by the infamous single <em>Luchini</em>, the duo came out the gate with a classic.</p><p>Unfortunately (from a commercial standpoint) the duo faded fast, and although they've released music since, they never again reached <em>Luchini</em> heights.</p><p>The song <em>Coolie High</em> was considered by many to be one of the dopest tracks on the album, and had they somehow gotten away with the sample of the original, they would have made a larger impact in my opinion.</p><p>Take a listen for yourself.

<strong>Artifacts - <em>Wrong Side Of The Tracks</em></strong>

Newark's own Artifacts, the duo of El Da Sensei and Tame One, have one of the dopest hip-hop classics ever – in fact it's one of my top 10 tracks ever in music.</p><p>The demo version, however, is a whole different beast.</p><p>It has a slight funk to it, and the infamous hook is sang by Brand Nubian rapper (and Vlad TV staple) Lord Jamar.</p><p>We think they made the right choice in the end.</p><p>Take a listen to the demo version for yourself.

<strong>Pete Rock CL Smooth - <em>T.R.O.Y </em></strong>

This is it folks, possibly the greatest sample ever in hip-hop!</p><p>Tom Scott's <em>Today</em> – better known as the sexy sax Pete Rock flipped in his landmark record <em>T.R.O.Y</em>.</p><p>The track made CL Smooth a star and certified Pete Rock's place in the production game.</p><p>The original though, didn't have quite the same spice...take a listen for yourself!
