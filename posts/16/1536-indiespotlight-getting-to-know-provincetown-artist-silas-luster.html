  <h1>#IndieSpotlight: Getting To Know Provincetown Artist Silas Luster</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>This week, we’re introducing you to Provincetown, Massachusetts, native Silas Luster — a filmmaker and hip-hop artist, who’s part of a bubbling creative collective called The BuLife. “I make music that is true to me,” he tells AAHH. “The inspiration from my everyday life, where I’m from, and what I’ve experienced so far in my life goes into music ... it’s real and it’s vulnerable.”

“There is content and emotion only my close friends know, things that I don’t like to speak on, that I put in my music,” he adds.</p><p>We initially got into Silas over the holidays after he floated me a visual for a “ZeZe” freestyle, that had this hard to explain flow that had us intrigued.</p><p>We uncovered lots of quality stuff while digging around.

“I like to show people a different perspective,” he says. “I know my sound is different, my story has layers to it ... if you give my music a little effort, you will understand my dedication and the depth in my artwork.”

Silas has been making both films and music since a youngster — messing around with a camera and whatever recording program he could get his hands on back in high school. “I took it more serious around 2014,” he explains.</p><p>That’s when I linked with @RichmondVisionStudio and really started locking in the studio recording.</p><p>To date, he’s released one solo mixtape, <em>Frick It</em>, and a few mixtapes with the BuLife collective: <em>The Rosenhan Experiment</em>, <em>Cape Tippin</em>, and <em>The Nor’Easter Tape</em>.</p><p>Most recently, they dropped last year’s <em>Beauty of the Day</em>.


&amp;nbsp;
Right now though, it’s all about Silas and his solo flex. “I’m working on my EP which will be fully produced by my homie TMAC .</p><p>I’m also always working on different music videos, films and my debut album.”

Having independently toured the North East with BuLife, he’s looking forward to locking down a couple dates for the near future — on top of just stacking up music. “We working,” he says. “A lot of music, visuals, shows, and creative content coming in 2019.</p><p>Look out for us.</p><p>BuLife!”</p></div>
