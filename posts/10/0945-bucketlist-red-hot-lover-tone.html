  <h1>#Bucketlist: Red Hot Lover Tone</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>It's impossible to discuss the legacy of hip-hop producers without mentioning Trackmasters – the duo of Tone &amp; Poke.</p><p>The duo are known for single handedly ushering in the jiggy era, takings Nas to the next level (commercially) and producing some of the most notable records in mainstream hip-hop, such as <em><a href=" The were the driving force behind the supergroup "The Firm", they were the first one's to give 50 cent a shot – they produced the bulk of his unreleased <em><a href="http://youtu.be/ej00u9qmzLQ">Power Of The Dollar </a></em>album – and have so many platinum plaques they can barely hang them all up on the wall.</p><p>But there are a few things they are often not remembered for such as their uncredited production of Biggie's <em><a href="http://youtu.be/vJC2ax18oQM">Who Shot Ya</a></em> and <em><a href="http://youtu.be/0Ogs_NsXh58">One More Chance</a></em> Remix.</p><p>Or how about the fact that produced both <em><a href="http://youtu.be/2o1pnMnNnP0">Ill Street Blues</a></em> and <em><a href="http://youtu.be/VTtrqJWolek">On The Run</a></em> by Kool G Rap?

Most overlooked though was that Tone, then known as Red Hot Lover Tone was actually a rapper!</p><p>He dropped not one but two albums on now defunct Select Records.</p><p>His first album doesn't really hold up, so we'll leave that out of this conversation; although, his second (and final) effort<a href=" <em>#1 Player</em></a> was a gem.</p><p>Featuring production from the likes of Diamond D and Buckwild (as well as young Trackmasters themselves) and features from LOTNS member Charlie Brown, Big Daddy Kane and Greg Nice.</p><p>There is one standout track here that make this album a must-listen: <a href=" My Peeps Remix</a> featuring Organized Konfusion, M.O.P and a young Notorious B.I.G – this is all of these artists in their 1995 form, so you know it's dope.</p><p>There are two versions of the song, but it' the Buckwild remix that really stands out to us.
