  <h1>EsZ – Breakfast & Sex</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sat, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Today we have a new joint by New York rapper EsZ -- a rapper who's no stranger to the staff here at AAHIPHOP.</p><p>In the past, we've featured his songs "Rose Petals" and "Away From Me." His latest is a change of pace from what we've shared with him thus far. "Breakfast &amp; Sex" is fresh, to the point: "if you say you gonna give it girl then give it girl, don't even flex, the BS that I want in life is Breakfast and Sex." Over catchy production, the track is worth a few spins.</p><p>Drop it into your weekend playlist!
