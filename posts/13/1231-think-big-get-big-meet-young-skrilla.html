"I like to make the  Cali music, sometimes some H-Town shit, sometimes the real shit, and sometimes the hype music.</p><p>Sometimes, I just do it all at once," says Skrilla when describing his sound.</p><p>While working hard in the studio, Skrilla recently took a few minutes out to chat with AAHIPHOP about his music, his influences, and what he has on the horizon.</p><p>Check out his latest visuals, and peep the interview below!

<b>How'd you get wrapped up in music?</b>

I was remixing Tupac songs when I was younger and -- for some reason -- I had the gift to learn songs very fast.</p><p>I was rapping some shit I probably didn't understand at the time .</p><p>My very first purchase was a Memphis Bleek CD that I'd bump every morning going to school.</p><p>Started messing around with the mic at 17 or 18-years old.</p><p>I was told by a fellow rapper  that I had potential and should take it seriously.</p><p>I had heard the word Skrilla being used when I went to school in Mississippi; that's where that came from.

<b>Who influenced your music?</b>

My influences musically aren't what you'd expect.</p><p>I used to -- and still do -- listen to a lot of reggae; Rebelution to be exact.</p><p>But, I'm not gonna lie and say I used to listen to the Jay-Z or NAS -- it was the old Weezy, Eminem, Kanye, Drake, and Kirko 

<b>What do you have floating around right now?</b>

I haven't released anything official other than The Rise of a Pharaoh tape which sold a good amount of units but didn't hit iTunes or anything: so, mainly just videos and remixes on Soundcloud.

<b>What do you have coming up?</b>

Currently working on finishing my first official EP -- it's still currently unnamed.</p><p>But, I want to bring something new to the table.</p><p>I want people  unsure of where I'm from because the music doesn't classify me; they're just hits.

<b>Tell about some of the achievements you're proud of this far.</b>

Biggest achievements would have to be opening for J.Cole and building a great audience/following .</p><p>My YouTube views being 70k+ makes me feel some type way.</p><p>Also, being in big studios like Soul Asylum in Atlanta, Georgia, or recording where the greats  in Houston, Texas.

<b>What are your goals in this rap shit?</b> 

My ultimate goal is to have a big enough platform to change people's minds about things.</p><p>I wanna spend all my money on other people.</p><p>I want to have fun -- no worries.</p><p>I want to give more than I receive with a heart full of sincerity; fuck 20 chains and a Ferrari, bro.</p><p>Let me pay some kids tuitions, straight up!</p></div>
