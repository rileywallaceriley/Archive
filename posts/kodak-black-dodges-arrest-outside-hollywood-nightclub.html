    <h1>Kodak Black Dodges Arrest Outside Hollywood Nightclub</h1>
    <div class="meta">2018-12-03 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Trouble-prone rapper Kodak Black dodged a (metaphorical) bullet after he was involved in a fight at Playhouse Nightclub on Friday, November 30. Though police were called to the Playhouse Nightclub in Hollywood, California — and Kodak was initially detained and cuffed — he walked away from the incident a free man.According to a TMZ report, the fight broke out a little after midnight; after police contained it, and were able to make sense of the situation, Kodak was released, and allegedly won't face any charges.</p>
<p>It's unclear if any arrests were made at all, however, it’s a lucky break for the “ZEZE” rapper, who was released early from jail this past August after serving seven months following a probation violation.The timing of this incident is curious though, considering his upcoming album Dying to Live is set to drop on December 14.[apple_news_ad type="standard"]</p></div>
