  <h1>Interview with Audiomack CMO David Ponte</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><blockquote><span class="s1"><span style="line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">We put songs that we feel strongly about in, essentially, a better position to be heard. </span></span></blockquote>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nowadays artists have a sea of options to share their music, including services like Bandcamp and the ever-popular behest that is Soundcloud.</p><p>Users can upload their songs to a profile, and freely share it across all of their networks with an easy-to-use responsive player; but, not without restrictions.</p><p>For users to access profile options, and sufficient space to upload a full catalogue, they have to pay. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Let's face it, being an indie artist isn't easy or cheap.</p><p>There's the cost of production, studios, mixing, mastering, marketing and so on.</p><p>That's where one streaming service is stepping in and giving artists a free, attractive option to host their releases.</p><p>Audiomack, the co-creation of David Ponte and DJBooth.net CEO David Macli, is quickly becoming the go-to choice for industry elite and indie upstarts alike.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The site gained major juice on the record-breaking front as of late, in fact, they broke Fetty-Wap's infectious <i>Trap Queen</i>.</p><p>Last week, I had the opportunity to chat with David Ponte, who shared some insight on the service's origins, and its plans for the future.</span></p>


<hr />
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Thanks for taking the time to talk to me, David!</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">No problem!</p><p>I am waiting for the internet guy to get our new office connected.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Where is your new office?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">New York City (still), in Soho – it's  a new office with a studio.</p><p>We have rappers and producers coming in regularly, and now we'll have the studio set up for those impromptu business meetings that turn into studio sessions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Very cool – so Audiomack becomes something bigger! </span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Exactly, an opportunity work directly with artists on their actual music, then help to proliferate their work online and spread the music to the masses.</p><p>That’s something in motion now.  </span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Is that something that you guys had in mind from the get-go or is that something that just happened organically?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I should mention that my partner is David Macli, CEO of DJBooth.net.</p><p>We're different companies, but there is obviously a lot of synergy between us.</p><p>DJ Booth is a hub of music premiers and editorial writing, while we're more of a utility for sharing music; but, as a result of our clear collaboration, we deal directly with artists all the time.</p><p>The emphasis for moving was first and foremost space, as we're growing, but finding an office with a studio was a factor when we were looking. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We're pretty lucky we're in a space that used to be a home base for producers like Emile (Kid Cudi) and Johnny Brooklyn (Rick Ross), amongst others.</p><p>A lot of well-known producers were here and created a lot of big-time songs, so we hope to continue that trend in addition to getting work done.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">What's your background?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My work background is in software technology, sales and marketing.</p><p>That’s where I met all my partners.</p><p>I continued to do that until the last week of December 2014 – and that's when I transferred to Audiomack full-time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Was Audiomack conceived to compliment DJ Booth?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">No, it wasn't meant to compliment DJ Booth – it was meant to fill a gap in the (hip-hop) on-line music distribution marketplace.</p><p>Before Audiomack, even before Soundcloud started to get a lot of traction, a <i>lot</i> of artists would use unprofessional file sharing sites to release music, and give away their promotional music and mixtapes.</p><p>These sites were shady, loaded with irrelevant ads, and generally, were <i>not</i> a great way to present themselves.</p><p>It was like spending three hours cooking a gourmet meal and then putting it on a paper plate to serve it.</p><p>So we wanted to make China dinnerware to serve hip-hop on. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">I notice the focus and roots of the service are mainly hip-hop, which is interesting – SoundCloud is more dance.</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When you're starting out in web properties you need to have a niche market – start small by getting your audience to buy the product and then broaden the field.</p><p>I listen to hip-hop, rap, and R&amp;B ninety percent of the time, so it's more natural for me to gravitate towards it; although, I'm becoming more interested in other mediums of music.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">With other services charging artists money to gain access to features, such as extra downloads, how have you been able to remain free?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We’ve been able to monetize very effectively with appropriate advertising.</p><p>We felt it would be better to make money that way, rather than to charge for subscription or a premium service.</p><p>Subsequently, it's helped drive our traffic.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">What have been some of your biggest tracks on Audiomack to date?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img class="alignleft" src="http://ts3.mm.bing.net/th?q=Trap%20Queen%20Fetty%20Wap+album+art" alt="Fetty Wap" width="299" height="300" />We put songs that we feel strong about in, fundamentally, a better position to be heard.</p><p>Fetty Wap's <a href=" Queen</em></a>, for example, which they're saying will be the song of the summer, broke on our site <i>last</i> summer.</p><p>Jennifer Lopez and Iggy Azalea's <a href=" remix was a huge record.</p><p>We've had some great songs break on our service thus far.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Do you guys censor artists?</p><p>Do you ever receive complaints?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We don't censor artists unless something is ultra malicious, and really, <i>really</i>, offending our users.</p><p>There was one time I remember, where the Atlanta Police Department hit us up about a project that a user had posted.</p><p>It turned out that the artist behind the tape, which was climbing the charts, was wanted for murder.</p><p>They were trying to find information on him.</p><p>We didn't have any clues to who this guy was and if the tape was his.</p><p>I hope that he got a fair trial and they got the answers they were looking for .</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">What is your take on the new streaming service that Jay-Z has come up with?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I don't think they're honest with the music community.</p><p>As far as we know, most of the artists involved (in Tidal) have 360 deals with the biggest labels in the world – such as Universal, Warner, Sony and all the subsidiary labels.</p><p>They say it’s for the people, but that’s B.S. It's a marketing strategy they are using to get consumers to buy in.</p><p>The labels will be involved in the streaming and get paid.</p><p>What's different is the artists get to be a part of the title, which will increase the value and equity of the company.</p><p>They're not transparent enough, but they don't have to.</p><p>However, the market is slowing, and not many people twenty-one and under will have the $20 per month (or $240 for the year), when they know that music can be accessed somewhere else for free. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">From what I understand of the service, it has a lot of neat features – so a lot of people will enjoy it.</p><p>It's just that the way it was presented to the market was flawed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Do you see Audiomack as the go-to over other competitors?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We hope so!</p><p>I think we have a lot of upcoming products and enhancements, in addition to our Audiomack premium products we have right now, that are – and will be – addressing the concerns of both artists and fans.</p><p>Listeners want to stream music for free.</p><p>Artists want to give music to as many fans as possible and make money to support their art.</p><p>Our stakeholders are crucial to Audiomack.</p><p>We want to increase the audience and the amount of artists that use the site – and we're confident we can.</p><p>We're providing a good product!</span></p>
