    <h1>Lil Pump Cuts The Shenanigans & Throws Skid Row A Pizza Party</h1>
    <div class="meta">2019-02-14 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Amid many controversies, "Harvard Dropout" Lil Pump isn't a name that fans often associate with charitable actions, but that could soon change. The 18-year-old visited Skid Row -- an area of Downtown L.A. with one of the largest populations of homeless people in the United States -- for an impromptu pizza party on Wednesday (February 13)."Feels good to give back," he wrote in the caption of a video shared to his Instagram. "Pizza party on skidrow ... God bless everyone." In the video, Pump is seen handing out boxes of pizza out of the trunk of his car as a crowd gathers.This random act of kindness comes days after he unleashed a busload of look-a-likes upon the Los Angeles' Staples Center on Sunday (February 10) during the Grammy festivities -- in promotion of his Harvard Dropout LP, which is dropping on February 22.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDNm_klkbh0</p></div>
