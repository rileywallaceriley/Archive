  <h1>Boldy James & Alchemist 'Super Tecmo Bo' Is A Worthy Expansion Pack To The Original</h1>
  <div class="meta">2021-12-31 — reviews</div>
  <div class="content"><p>The Alchemist and Boldy James have released their new album Super Tecmo Bo.</p><p>HipHopDX breaks down the new Boldy James and Alchemist album.In 2020, Griselda rhymer Boldy James dropped four projects, several of which were among his best material to date.</p><p>This year has been relatively quiet in comparison with only a single release, Bo Jackson (a collaboration with 2021 HipHopDX Producer of the Year Alchemist).</p><p>However, the project  was no less potent in impact, ranking among the year's best.</p><p>Having just dropped in August, and still supporting that release with the video for “Flight Risk” being released just two weeks ago, the duo re-converged (or perhaps unearthed cut material) for one last hurrah before the ball drops, Super Tecmo Bo.</p><p>The title and incredible artwork are a nod to the 1989 NES game Tecmo Super Bowl, in which Bo Jackson was virtually invincible.</p><p>Comically so.For fans of Boldy's darker than midnight in the woods without a flashlight wordplay and intricate use of detail, there is undoubtedly some upper echelon gems present. "Moth In The Flame" sees him rhyming in his usual cool as a cucumber cadence about the atrocities of gang life with a menacing desensitized tone.Then there's "300 Fences," a storytelling joint that takes him from picking up his son — who he left with his father while doing dirt — to getting into an argument with his baby mother and leading police on highspeed chase before escaping on foot.</p><p>The pacing and Boldy's flow make it an  engaging listen.While Bo Jackson touted a lot of great guests, this project has one lone feature, bubbling L.A. rapper ICECOLDBISHOP, who drops a standout verse on "Hot Water Tank"— a clear highlight of the release.</p><p>Al's drums over the bouncy whistle sounds make this song one of the brightest moments on the tracklist, sonically speaking.From a production standpoint, Alc shows and proves why he was chosen to rock the crown as DX's best beatmaker of the past 365 days.</p><p>He continues to expand the immense chemistry he and Boldy have together while providing soundscapes sequenced so well that they could easily play just as engaging as an instrumental-only affair.  the first four songs on the project already appearing on the limited edition vinyl release of Bo Jackson, this album ends up feeling like a bonus disc.</p><p>Albeit, that four-song sequence wasn't available for streaming until now.</p><p>The songs are up to par but as a companion piece to a serious AOTY contender, it doesn't measure up to the material on the original.</p><p>Casual fans especially won't find much to take home.</p><p>For the hardened listeners, it's short and sweet but there aren't many surprises.</p><p>Fans of the original will get what they came for though — 26 minutes of Boldy rapping with the spirit of Bo running over would be tacklers to paydirt.REPEAT ME:FAN FEEDBACK:</p></div>
