  <div class="content"><p>Having just recovered from an obsession with singer Alina Baraz, Incan across a new, sultry vocalist to play on repeat.</p><p>Her name is Juvahn Victoria, and she's a Sydney, Australia, based artist with super sexy voice, and a ton of mainstream potential.</p><p>She's currently working with producer Divy Pota, who is a huge chart-topping producer down under.</p><p>His work has accumulated over 120 million views on YouTube and sold over 100,000 units, as well as helping to usher in success for artists like Faydee – who is a huge deal.</p><p>Her jazzy, soulful style and songwriting rides over the bassy electronic, trap/pop beats found on her SoundCloud – and delivers a-class performances that I'm sure will be a springboard to big things for the singer.</p><p>Her most recent upload (above) has been on repeat over here for the last few hours; give her a few spins, and if you're loving it, check out some of the work she completed with Divy below.</p><p>Their full-length collaborative release is dropping later this year.
