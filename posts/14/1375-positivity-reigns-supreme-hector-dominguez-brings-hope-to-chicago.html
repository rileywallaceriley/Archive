  <h1>Positivity Reigns Supreme: Hector Dominguez Brings Hope To Chicago</h1>

  <div class="content"><p><blockquote>"If you look close enough, you can always find something beautiful growing from underneath the dirt." --Hector Dominguez</blockquote>
Artist Hector Dominguez, who hails from Chicago's Humboldt Park Community is using his platform to bring another voice to Hip Hop. "We live in a day where everyone is talking about how many bodies they’ve dropped, how many drugs they’ve done, how many men/woman they’ve slept with—and that’s all cool," he says disapprovingly. "There is obviously a lane and market for that right now, but I just wanted to bring a different voice.</p><p>I want to pay homage to the great story tellers and influencial figures in the culture with everything that I do."

It's a noble direction for an artist from his city; although many more positive figures have emerged from the city, such as Chance The Rapper who has donated well over $3 million to the city's school board, most seem to go left. "Music has always been therapy for me, and I wanna bring hope to my hometown."

Get to know Hector a little better in the interview below.</p><p>He tells AAHH about his sound, direction, and goals.

<strong>Tell me about the music -- describe your sound.</strong>

The only way I could describe my sound would be if Eminem and Selena Quintanilla had a baby and then went out on a date—and let Bone Thugs n Harmony babysit.</p><p>It sounds weird, but my music encompasses hip hop culture, Latin culture (I’m Puerto Rican), Jazz, Trap, storytelling.</p><p>Just a big mix of everything I grew up listening to.

<strong>How did you get involved in music?</strong>

I was real suicidal when I was younger.</p><p>I had a lot of pain and anger growing up and had nowhere to go with that pain.</p><p>Like a lot of people in my neighborhood, I grew up submerged in drugs, gangs, murder and violence but for some reason, I never had a desire to get involved in any of that.</p><p>I knew a bunch of kids like me growing up, and many fell victim to that, and I believe it was because everyone that we looked up to was doing the same thing.</p><p>I grew up knowing I wanted to make a difference and give an alternative outlet for someone who comes from what we come from.

<strong>Who/what were some of your influences?</strong>

Musically, some of my influences are Big Pun, Fat Joe, Bone Thugs n Harmony, Twista, Common, Kanye, Eminem, The Game, J Cole, Biggie, Nas, Pac, Lecrae; the list can go on forever.

<strong>What have you released?</strong>

So to date, I have put out 3 Retail Albums with <em>MISUNDERSTOOD</em> being the most recent, but I’ve been making music since I was 16 years old.</p><p>I have put out 29 mixtapes since then, and these are 12-15 song mixtapes.</p><p>I used to go to class and have Limewire (STD for a computer) running on a computer downloading every instrumental I could get.</p><p>I had over 1TB of beats at one time.</p><p>I’m happy to say I’ve grown since then lyrically, so please no one go searching for those .

<strong>What are you currently working on?</strong>

With the political climate that we are currently in, especially being of Latin descent, I feel it is necessary to create a project along with others who some Americans feel the need to label as immigrants—and celebrate all of our cultures.</p><p>I don’t have a name right now, and I’m still playing around with song ideas, but my next project for sure will be a different flavor than many may be used to.</p><p>What have been some of your biggest achievements thus far?</p><p>My biggest achievement so far might be a little different than you might think.</p><p>As a rapper, the goal is often to get the biggest shows and to record the most fire verses, and none of those things are bad things.</p><p>I’ve been able to travel and make music across the country.</p><p>I have done many of Chicago’s biggest radio station events as a walk on—no invitation .</p><p>I am the first Latin rapper to do the Chicago Gospel Fest.</p><p>Those are all great things that I will forever cherish, but none of that compares to marring the woman of my dreams and God blessing us with two beautiful children.</p><p>I love my wife, son, and daughter more than anything else on this earth.

<strong>What are your goals in the industry?</strong>

I don’t want to be famous.</p><p>I ain't built for that.</p><p>I am not about people getting into my personal life and taking pictures of my kids and trying to sell them and make millions.</p><p>I would love to have a dope core fan base that can support my music so I could support my family.</p><p>While many aspire to be the next Wayne or Drake, I just wanna be faithful with the gift that God gave me.</p><p>I wanna be that dude who can still walk through his old neighborhood and be an inspiration to kids.</p><p>I want my life to be a reflection of something more than just record sales.

<strong>What's next for you, professionally?</strong>

Chicago has a lot of artists that no one knows about and I wanna change that.</p><p>I wanna use my platform to elevate others.</p><p>I know this is supposed to be about me—and I appreciate the opportunity—but, please go check out Cell Blok, Brother 3, Aasha Marie, DTS, VOP, Clarence J, and Austin Downing.</p><p>Those are just a few.</p><p>Please give Chicago a chance.</p><p>I know we have a bad rap, being this “Chiraq,” but if you look close enough, you can always find something beautiful growing from underneath the dirt.</p></div>
