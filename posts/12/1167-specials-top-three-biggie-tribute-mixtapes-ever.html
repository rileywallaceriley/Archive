  <h1>Special's Top Three Biggie Tribute Mixtapes – Ever!</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sat, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>It’s been 19 years today since the Notorious BIG passed away; although, it seems like yesterday for OG heads.</p><p>Often included in the average MC’s top list, Biggie was a highly influential figure in the NYC scene, and was responsible for helping a lot of people solidify their names in the rap world.</p><p>For the past (almost) two decades since his passing, many DJ’s have tried their hand at crafting remixes and re-working the (sadly) limited amount of material he left us with, attempting to give fans a new B.I.G experience.</p><p>I’ve taken the liberty of rounding-up three of the best – and most creative – Biggie tapes I've come across.
<b>
“Rap Phenomenon”
DJ Vlad &amp; DJ Dirty Harry</b>

</b>
If you’ve never heard this tape, it easily stands as one of the finest – and most iconic – Notorious B.I.G mixtapes out there.</p><p>This installment of their award winning "Rap Phenomenon" series was an example of both Vlad in his prime, almost a decade away from launching VladTV.com, and DJ Dirty Harry's legendary blending.</p><p>The two traded over forty mind-blowing original mixes; keep in mind, this was pre-torrent days, so their stock of Biggie accapellas was a big deal.</p><p>Especially the (then) rare ones like “Cars Sex,” “Buddy X,” and “House Of Pain.”

<b>“Best Of Notorious BIG”
DJ M-Rock</b>

<a href="https://m.mixcloud.com/themixfeed/dj-m-rock-the-best-of-notorious-big/"><img width="100%"' alt="" src="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/img_1736-1.jpg" title="" class="size-custom"></a>

Award-winning Toronto DJ, M-Rock, has made massive noise over the past few years.</p><p>He rocks parties as a resident DJ in the 6, had MTV nodding to his mixtapes, and had CNN mentioning his remixes.</p><p>He’s received widespread blog love for his “Best Of” mixes, including Beastie Boys and Kanye West, but this Biggie mix is a sheer masterpiece.</p><p>Unlike some of the mixes out there, it’s heavily cut up – making it an extremely original/exciting listen.

<b>“The Notorious BIG Tribute”
DJ Drama &amp; Cookin Soul</b>

This one is more of a tribute in the literal sense.</p><p>Drama and Cookin’ Soul rounded up a who’s who of NYC rappers, like Tek of Smiff N Wessun, Skyzoo, CL Smooth, Jean Grae, Uncle Murda and more.</p><p>It features original and remixed production, as the artists pay tribute to one of the greatest to ever touch a mic.</p><p>Salute the king of Brooklyn.</p></div>
