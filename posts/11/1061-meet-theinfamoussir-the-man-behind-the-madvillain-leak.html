  <h1>Meet @TheInfamousSIR, The Man Behind The MADVILLAIN Leak</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>You can't stop the leaks – and that's a fact.</p><p>Many artists over the years have fallen victim to album leaks.</p><p>Some artists have taken counter measures and simply released their projects early in an attempt to curb potential buyers from grabbing the album for free.</p><p>Others, unfortunately, weren't so lucky; however, that was then, this is now.</p><p>In an internet age where we've seen larger scale projects drop with no notice, leaks seem kind of played out.</p><p>I mean, aside from the fact that artists refer to their own promo tracks as "leaks" from upcoming albums, many leaks are calculated marketing schemes hatched by agencies.</p><p>Sometimes, in some rare occasions, we stumble upon a leak that takes us back to the old days.</p><p>I'm talking the days when DJ Clue leaked Biggie Smalls on the radio.</p><p>Last week, it felt that way.</p><p>Madvillain, which is a duo made of Madlib and MF DOOM, has been hinting at a follow up to their cult classic for years, and last week we finally for a taste of it, from an unlikely source – a 15 year old rapper from Glasgow.</p><p>Two songs, one called <em>Untitled</em> feat MED, and another called <em>Travis 911</em>, appeared on Reddit/Soundcloud.</p><p>So how did this kid end up with unreleased Madvillian tunes?</p><p>I had to chat with him to find out more.

<strong>So, who are you?
</strong>
I'm a bored teenager from Glasgow of all places.</p><p>I've been a fan of MF DOOM for the longest time.</p><p>He inspired me to start rapping.</p><p>I've been doing it since I was 9, but started taking it seriously as of late.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Well, my friends and people from my school said they liked my rapping.

<strong>Let's get right into it – how'd you get the tracks?</strong>

They were floating about the MF DOOM sub-reddit  for the longest time.</p><p>I had the tracks for a month, and gave it to fans I met online.</p><p>It didn't click to upload the tracks until I saw a comment from someone on sub-reddit "hiphopheads” asking about a “supposed” song DOOM actually recorded for the long-awaited new Madvillain album.</p><p>I uploaded them, and it blew up from there.</p><p>I originally gave credit to the actual leaker, but he messaged me and asked me not to.

<strong>Has Stonesthrow contacted you?
</strong>
They did!</p><p>They asked me to take them down, and when I didn't they "copyright claimed" me, then said "Thanks for nothing loser”.</p><p>We had a few back and forth messages arguing.</p><p>I don't think they liked it, but I did give them a lot of publicity.

<strong>You’re a rapper yourself.</p><p>Has anyone contacted you about your music as a result of all this?
</strong>
Over my rapping?</p><p>Nah, but I haven't even put out a tape yet – so I expect it; That's why I'm doing two tapes.</p><p>To double my chances of becoming the greatest Glasgow rapper.

<strong>Tell me a bit about your music.</strong>

I'm still working on my own style.</p><p>My biggest influence is DOOM, like many others, and I've put a few songs on Soundcloud; however, I took down most of them since I rushed them.</p><p>My first mixtape it is going to be called That's What I Call Fire ’15.</p><p>It’ll be me rapping about mostly drugs (original I know) and some other stuff.</p><p>For the second one is going to be a collaborative project with my friend, who's a producer.</p><p>I'm still at the awkward stage of trying to find my style of rapping, but I'll definitely find it before I upload the tapes; if you like DOOM or Quasimoto (Stonesthrow kind of stuff) then you may like my upcoming tapes.

<strong>What were you hoping to gain from this leak?
</strong>
Nothing really – I just wanted to make people happy, and promote DOOM as much as I can.</p><p>I want to be a part of Madvillain history; kind of funny, cause now my friends joke that I'm like the third Madvillain because of the leaks.

<strong>Any last words?
</strong>
I promise that I’ll be working hard on these two tapes.</p><p>I’m trying to make my first tape be both on par with my idols and something my friends (and admirers) can enjoy.</p><p>Follow me on twitter: @TheInfamousSIR and Snapchat sherlock148.

<strong>UPDATE:</strong> both tunes have been taken down.</p><p>In an effort to stay in everyone's good book, we're going to refrain from posting them right now.</p><p>But, a little digging does a body good!</p></div>
