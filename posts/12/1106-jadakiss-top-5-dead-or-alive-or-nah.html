  <h1>Jadakiss – Top 5 Dead Or Alive Or Nah?</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Jadakiss is a formidable voice in the rap game.</p><p>He has a distinctive cadence that would stand out in a crowd of a million rappers, and a track record that dates back to the days when B.I.G had NYC – and hip-hop – on lock.</p><p>He's often been quoted as claiming himself top 5 "dead or alive," which he takes to the next level with his aptly titled album, <i>Top 5 Dead Or Alive</i>.</p><p>Bold right?</p><p>The question is, does the album live up to that name?</p><p>Well, in my humble opinion, no.</p><p>Is it a good album?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>I'll explain.</p><p>Almost ironically, the album's second song, <i>The Shop Skit</i>, has a group of men discussing his (Jada's) accolades while getting lined up.</p><p>One man remarks that "he can't just rely on bars anymore." Why is this ironic, well, because it unintentionally – or maybe intentionally – sets the tone for the album.</p><p>Top 5 DOA does little to stand out from everything else that's out now.</p><p>Collaborations with Weezy, Jeezy and Future, are dope, but aren't anything special or innovative; however, they are lyrically dope.</p><p>That's the conundrum I'm having with this album.</p><p>Jada is on point; he just doesn't stray too far from the same few topics over and over, making it boring at times.</p><p>There are some dope joints here, though.</p><p>He teams up with Styles for their signature back and fourth flow on <i>Synergy</i>, and he trades veteran bars with Mass Appeal head honcho Nas on <i>Rain</i>.</p><p>As well, <i>You Don't Eat</i>, featuring Diddy, <i>Man In The Mirror</i> – and even the Nipsey and Ne-Yo featured <i>Ain't Nothin' New</i> – offer some of the J-to-the-muah 'Fung Shui' I was hoping for.</p><p>Top 5 DOA?</p><p>Well, with a few decades of consistency under his belt, it's hard not at least to put his name in the running.</p><p>He's cut from a cloth that isn't quite appreciated as much as it once was.</p><p>He's a super dope lyricist, but sometimes I find he panders to the mainstream more than I like.</p><p>Overall, it's a solid effort – and worth bumping.</p><p>If you're a Jadakiss' head, you'll be more than appeased.
