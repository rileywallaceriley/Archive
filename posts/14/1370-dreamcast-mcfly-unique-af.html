  <h1>Dreamcast McFly: Unique AF</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Dreamcast McFly; an Avante Garde Hip-Hop artist who bends the rules of rap's basic songwriting structure and brings in elements from multiple genres. "When asked how I feel about this music, I'm quick to tell anyone that Hip-Hop is life and what keeps me alive," he says.</p><p>Staying isolated from other artists, Dreamcast will go on for months not listening to any mainstream album while he's working on the writing process for his projects.</p><p>There are talks of an upcoming album this year named <em>Pegasus</em>, which he only describes as "a depressing love story," as well as a few tracks floating around the net.</p><p>Currently, on his Youtube page you can view his visual treatment for his single "Joyride," and filming has begun for his gritty smash "Harlem Knights."

"Ironically, I thought only street dudes would enjoy this record, but when I perform it, I notice women paying attention too.</p><p>I guess it's a record that has universal appeal?</p><p>I'm going to be spending a lot of energy as a creative consultant, working on other NY artists music videos, and will be a regular comedic panelist on the Verbal Assault Talk Show," says Dreamcast when discussing what's up next.</p><p>For now, check out his music and get familiar.
