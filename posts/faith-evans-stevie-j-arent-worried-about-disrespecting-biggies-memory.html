    <h1>Faith Evans & Stevie J Aren’t Worried About Disrespecting Biggie’s Memory</h1>
    <div class="meta">2018-11-21 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Despite what people may think of the union between singer Faith Evans and producer Stevie J, the pair insists the late Notorious B.I.G. wouldn’t have objected to their marriage.“Listen, it’s 27 years later and I’m sure he’d be happy that she’s happy,” Stevie said in a recent interview. “He’d be doing his thing. I just make sure that she’s good and we’re good.”Though Stevie is the godfather of C.J.</p>
<p>Wallace — the son Biggie fathered with Evans — Evans insists that Biggie would have no issue with the marriage, as the two were friends but not part of the same crew.“If I started dating Lil Cease or Nino [Brown] or Banger or somebody, then I would look at myself like, ‘Bitch, what are you doing?’” she said during the same interview.Some people seem to have ignored the 14-year marriage Evans had to Todd Russaw post-Biggie and pre-Stevie.In addition to the child they had together, Stevie and Evans have a clan of 10 children. “That’s a lot,” Stevie joked.Stevie first worked with Evans on her 1996 cut "I Just Can't" from the High School High Original Soundtrack. He later remixed "Soon As I Get Home" from her debut album, Faith.</p>
<p>He also produced some massive records on Biggie’s sophomore album, including “Last Days” and “Mo’ Money, Mo’ Problems.”https://youtu.be/1bBd_Tz63CI</p></div>
