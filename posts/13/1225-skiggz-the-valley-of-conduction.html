  <h1>Skiggz -- The Valley Of Conduction</h1>

--Skiggz</blockquote>
People love a good "follow your dreams" story -- and as such, it's a common theme in many movies and children's stories.</p><p>If you're a hip-hop head, it's also the common thread that many of the younger artists of today share.</p><p>Unlike golden era artists, a lot of the younger rappers have seen artists reach astronomical highs.</p><p>Hence, the idea that 'you can do this too, just believe' is prevalent.</p><p>For some, though, that allure is just too strong; it's consuming, and -- if they follow their hearts -- leads listeners on facing ting journeys.</p><p>Logic is one example, and another is a young artist named Skiggz, who's album <i>The Valley Of Conduction</i> made its way across my desk today.</p><p>At a hefty 18-tracks long, it's one year labor of love from a young artist who left his hometown of Indiana to move to the deserts of Phoenix, Arizona, to  and pursue his passion, hip-hop.</p><p>What he delivers is an odyssey that reads as both a celebration of his dream-chasing, and an open letter that address his haters and loved ones simultaneously.</p><p>Each song reads as a milestone on his year-long cross-country journey, which he describes lovingly as "Telling a story without telling a story.</p><p>He kicks off the project with a blunted expedition across the desert, "Lewis &amp; Clark." He then gives us more insight into his origins on the -- oddly endearing -- "Carry On." As he explains, his father always wanted him to carry on and not get carried away; however, the allure of seeing what else is out there, and living with the 'what if' was too powerful.</p><p>He drops a powerful gem when he says, "If you make the move, you better find a way to prove it." That one line sums up how this album felt, to me.</p><p>Proving to himself, and everyone else, that he has what it takes.</p><p>The album seems incredibly honest, with Skiggz not being afraid to be an open book, and commit to the process.</p><p>As he explains, "I got all the major keys in there." His track, "I Been," feat.</p><p>Digitz, is an example of how candid he gets.</p><p>The song  to rapper ESP, with whom  had a heavy falling out with during the course of the year.</p><p>ESP, a longtime friend from the mid-west, was one of the two features on the project -- and the fact that Skiggz details a falling out with him, while also featuring his vocals on the project is pretty real, TBH.

<i>The Valley Of Conduction</i> is a dope listen; it's personal without being polarizing, and as individual as his experience, his journey along the road to whatever he perceives his top to be is heavily relatable.</p><p>Amidst some dope sound beds, and with a cadence that almost sounds like a mixture of Young Sinatra, Logic, blended with J.Cole, the project is easy to enjoy -- and worth a spot on your weekend playlist.</p><p>It was Skiggz himself that says you can't improve if you don't have anything to prove.</p><p>Well, on this LP he sounds hungry like he has everything to prove.</p><p>Bonus points, it has extremely dope cover art.
