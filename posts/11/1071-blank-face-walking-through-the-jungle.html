—Blank Face</blockquote>
I consider myself to be tastemaker of sorts, and often find myself sifting through endless seas of "next-up" rappers looking for unique voices we can champion here at AAHIPHOP.</p><p>The other day, while creeping accounts  that liked one of my recent photos on Instagram, I came across a super dope illustration of the rap's elite with their heads on stakes...</p><p>I clicked through and discovered a young Brooklyn cat by the name of Blank Face.</p><p>The artwork in question was the cover for a track called <i>Jungle</i>, a 7 minute assault on the the upper echalon of "power rappers" who currently run the North American scene.</p><p>Now, this concept is fully unique, but his bars and voice were.</p><p>I began diggin through his Soundcloud to see if the joint was a fluke – but it wasn't!</p><p>He has this grimey New York vibe that I grew up idolizing, with an obvious hunger thatbyiu only get with younger cats.</p><p>He has serious skills, and I wanted to introduce him to all of you!</p><p>Peep the Q&amp;A below.

<b>How did you get into hip-hop?</b>

The first song I ever heard was Tupac's <i>How Do You Want It</i>.</p><p>After I heard that song, I was hooked.</p><p>I started to rewrite his lyrics on old school notebooks.</p><p>Soon, I started to replace words with my own...</p><p>And next thing you know, I had sheets and sheets of rhymes and ideas.</p><p>I started digging into the crates to learn the origins, and become a great listener of everything that had to do with Hip-Hop.

<b>Who are some of your influences?</b>

Some major influences of mine are Tupac, Biggie, Pusha T, Eminem, J.Cole, Kendrick, Wu-Tang – and can't forget 50 Cent!</p><p>He's One of my favourites.

<b>Tell me about <i>Jungle</i>.</b>

<i>Jungle</i> was originally suppose to be a 3 minute song.</p><p>I wrote it frustrated at the current state of hip hop.</p><p>I hate that it's not about lyrics anymore – it's about a hot beat and hook...</p><p>There isn't any substance.</p><p>I was basically letting all my favourite rappers know that I respect them enough to compete against them in any form, to prove I'm a worthy opponent .</p><p>The hook was <i>supposed</i> to be me piecing together a bunch of interviews from all the rappers I mentioned throughout the song, but it was still missing something and it sounded to forced and clustered.</p><p>My Producer, manager and I sat on the record for about a week and a half – and then they came over to my crib to see what we could brainstorm.</p><p>A third verse became the option but not just any verse...</p><p>It had to be powerful, and we didn't wanna just extend the beat.</p><p>We were playing some instrumentals and then it just happened.</p><p>Mobb Deep's <i>Shook One's</i> came on, and we began to chop it up.</p><p>I wrote <i>way</i> more then I was suppose to, so we extended the beat twice – and I still had too many bars!</p><p>We went to the studio a few days later, recorded it, and it came out crazy.</p><p>We had that song for maybe 4 months and then we finally decided to drop it. 7 minutes of Damage.

<b>Who did that crazy cover?</b>

I do all my own artwork.</p><p>I have a Degree in Graphic Design – and I'm a Fine Artist as well (with pencil and paper).

<b>What are you currently working on?</b>

I'm currently working on a project called <i>H3ZUS LINX</i>.</p><p>It's basically me using a Jesus chain as a metaphor for being detached from God...</p><p>It should be a really dope project, not sure on how many tracks but it's def on the way.</p><p>I should be dropping the first track in about a week or two, once I finish the artwork for it.</p><p>I'm also working on a 90s RNB Project using samples of old RNB songs that were poppin in the 90s.

<b>Do you perform live?</b>

Yeah, I perform live at open mic's.</p><p>I usually post it on Instagram prior to the performance of where people can go to see me.

<b>Where can people find you?</b>

You can find me on Instagram @IAmBlankFace and you can check me out On SoundCloud - BlankFaceNYC.</p></div>
