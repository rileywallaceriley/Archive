  <div class="content"><p>Singer Justine Skye was reluctant to explicitly say Sheck Wes was her abuser upon the October 2018 release of her "Build" video.</p><p>But, she had a change of heart on Tuesday night (February 11) following an alleged attack by the "Mo Bamba" creator and his crew."Taking a walk with my friends and my man and Sheck Wes (my abuser) and his friends decide to STALK US and attack my friends," Skye wrote on Twitter. "Two cars full of niggas while he sat in the car like a bitch.</p><p>You’re pathetic sheck and you beat women."She added, "You hit your girl before me and you’ll do it again."Wes vehemently denied her allegations via Twitter on Tuesday (February 12)."I’ve chosen to remain silent until now out of respect for actual victims of abuse," he wrote. "But I cannot stand by while lies are repeatedly told about me ...</p><p>I never hit or beat any women and I did not beat up or jump anybody."Skye responded by accusing Wes of hopping a fence at her home to attack her.</p><p>She produced a video from the alleged incident as well as a text message in which she states she locked herself in her room for safety and was "fucking terrified."Wes claimed the video actually showed him hopping a fence to get his things back after she refused to return them.</p><p>Skye refuted his story."Refused?</p><p>THIS specific incident was BECAUSE I was trying to give you your things," she wrote. "you decided to react violently and irrational because you 'are a grown ass man and I’m not going to disrespect you' because I put them in garbage bags for you to pick up.Skye also accused Wes of slapping her at a hotel.</p><p>The G.O.O.D. Music artist said she was lying and shared his side of the story."This is a complete lie," Wes responded. "I called my hotel to come get you away from me because i stayed there a lot and i was a young artist scared and afraid of a girl like you .</p><p>All this back and forth is childish , people talk and resolve or go to police not provoke social mediaThe allegations against Wes are already having a negative effect on his career.</p><p>On Tuesday, Major League Soccer announced it removed him from its promotional campaign for the 2019 season."In light of the recent news regarding Sheck Wes, he is no longer part of the campaign," the league said in a press statement.</p></div>
