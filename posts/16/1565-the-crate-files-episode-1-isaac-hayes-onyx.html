<p>One of the simplest pleasures in my life is record digging.</p><p>In a world where the physical joys of mining for musical gems have been replaced by the overt convenience of using apps and streaming, I find it comforting flipping through the vinyl at mom &amp; pop shops.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I especially glean particular happiness in finding samples from eras past that helped to influence or serve as the backbone for others records I love from ages past.</p><p>I love the discovery process, I love the rabbit holes it sends me on, and I love falling in love with songs I may have forgotten about all over again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With COVID-19 essentially taking this away from me, I was ecstatic when my local shop — following all possible precautions — opened again recently.&amp;nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's a second-hand spot, and each Tuesday, a regional collector and former multi-location record store owner drops by and removes all the records on the shelf and replaces them with a completely new batch.</p><p>So, it's like the first of the month for the diggers in my city.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I've been sharing my finds via Instagram for the past year or so, but I thought there was an opportunity to give more context and maybe entice some younger diggers to keep the art alive.</p><p>So, here goes part one of, well, many.</p>

<p><strong>Episode 1</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On a dig last month, I came upon an Isaac Hayes LP that I hadn't heard of, <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7JzzoHn2JV3VYOQ9Pf3j82?si=r-cNR68OTfy04p4lf4bveQ">And </a><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7JzzoHn2JV3VYOQ9Pf3j82?si=r-cNR68OTfy04p4lf4bveQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Once Again</a></em>.</p><p>I generally grab anything with Isaac's name on it when I'm going through crates, but was confused as to why I hadn't come across this one before.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was his fifteenth LP and — like most of his late 70s to early 80s run (I'm learning) — it's gotten lost in the shuffle of time.&amp;nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although it appears to have been successful, peaking at No. 52 on the Billboard Hot 200 in 1980 when it dropped, I wasn't blown away at first spin.</p><p>It has the vibe of his <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0zYfUaLDEeWVYkohFTVLmd?si=JVTAm4P6TsmEoZM5xKlAUA">Black M</a>oses</em> LP, but not quite as gripping, to me anyway.</p><p>That was until I hit "Wherever You Are."&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>The song's intro has appeared in a few low-key bangers over the years. "<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.whosampled.com/sample/259569/Freddie-Gibbs-Madlib-Scarface-Broken-Isaac-Hayes-Wherever-You-Are/">Broken"</a>&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.whosampled.com/Freddie-Gibbs/">Freddie Gibbs</a>&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.whosampled.com/Madlib/">Madlib</a>&amp;nbsp;(off <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/43uErencdmuTRFZPG3zXL1?si=WTaSv8fnSGKptDu6-2eH_g">Piñata</a></em>) is one, and my fav song off of Carl Thomas' <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5fjNNSyiwXoOQMCW4dLjJ2?si=-ngDyqxsSNqjINqCnV-e7A">Bad Boy debut LP</a> "<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.whosampled.com/sample/32216/Carl-Thomas-Giving-You-All-My-Love-Isaac-Hayes-Wherever-You-Are/">Giving You All My Love"</a>&amp;nbsp;being another.&amp;nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But neither of these even come close to "Live Niguz" by Southside Jamaica Queens legends, ONYX.</p><p>Not only did the song appear on their sophomore LP, <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2tIjXLaBInbrlYGFaPH3Us?si=o-ya8XbrRzmKCBBb3rPNLQ">All We Got Iz Us</a></em>, but it also — more notably to be — was a single from the soundtrack of The Show (an often forgotten Def Jam documentary).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back in 1995, this soundtrack was everything — also playing home to the iconic single "How High" by Redman and Method Man.&amp;nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This one has been slept on as time has gone on ... it was one of the trio's least successful singles during their first iteration (and really, commercial apex); it became their first single not to reach the Billboard Hot 100. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was also produced by Fredro Starr, which is a delightful little pop-up video.&amp;nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those who maybe aren't aware, Fredro is credited with producing a large portion of this LP, including some of (in my opinion) their most essential joints — like "Last Dayz," "Walk In New York" and the title track.</p><p>Not to mention other songs on later projects, like the OG album version of "Shut 'Em Down." He needs his roses, but I digress.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Definitely a great come up for my collection.</p><p>Check out Isaac Haye's "Wherever You Are" and a playlist of the songs mentioned in the article below.</p>
