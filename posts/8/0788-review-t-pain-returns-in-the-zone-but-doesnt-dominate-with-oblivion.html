  <h1>Review: T-Pain Returns In The Zone But Doesn't Dominate With “OBLiViON”</h1>
  <div class="meta">2017-11-17 — reviews</div>
  <div class="content"><p>It’s been almost six years since “Rappa Ternt Sanga” T-Pain has released a complete body of new work.</p><p>His latest effort, OBLiViON, succeeds in delivering what’s expected from an artist of his caliber with a few moments of sparkling brilliance, but still tends to blend in with the minions he helped create over all these years.Since he burst onto the scene with a (once) unique schtick, many artists have muscled their way into his lane.</p><p>Even post-D.O.A., a whole new generation of artists has blurred the lines between rap and R&B and others, such as Ty Dolla $ign and Travis Scott, have seemed to pick up the Auto-Tuned torch in his absence.But, the modern-day godfather of the rhythm-and-blues voice enhancement is back. of the gate, he stakes his dominance on "Who Died," which is a clear message to his detractors. "I hit Billboard with a baseball bat, hit after hit," he raps melodically before exclaiming "these niggas tryin' to erase all that."When T-Pain adds a hint of artistic foreplay to his endless sexual conquests, he catches his stride.</p><p>He clicks on the first single, the late-night hype banger "Textin' My Ex" featuring Tiffany Evans.</p><p>It’s a slow, bassy groove produced by Dre Moon (of "Drunk In Love" fame).</p><p>While not straying too far thematically, it’s executed more tastefully.Then there's one of the strongest records, "May I" featuring Christian artist My Talkbox, with its '90s-tinged vocoder laced vocals and extended piano solo amid live instrumentation.</p><p>The live feeling of the song definitely harkens back to the same magic created in his stripped-down NPR Tiny Desk performance.He’s at his most diverse on the project closer, "Second Chance (Don't Back Down)" featuring famed Italian pianist and composer Roberto Cacciapaglia.</p><p>The song's message is especially poignant if one considers the current controversy surrounding Meek Mill. “I’ve been called a murderer, a killer, I’m just playing with the hand that they deal us,” he sings before adding “in this cray world we all deserve a second chance.” It’s an actual moment of artistic evolution — one that seemed ironically almost non-existent on his past project, rEVOLVEr."Getcha Roll On," another clear standout, with its upbeat march and fluid storytelling, doesn't appear on the retail release due to a clearance issue.</p><p>Featuring Tory Lanez, the song feels like a lead single when we bumped the early press advance — hopefully it'll find itself on a deluxe release.As is the case with his past projects, OBLiViON scores points with incredible production and quality guest features.</p><p>It’s a solid project, but it also covers a lot of previously trodden ground.</p><p>Pairings with familiar collaborations such as Chris Brown and Ne-Yo seem safe and overly predictable, even though the silky "Classic You" proves he and Breezy will forever have that Walt and Jesse chemistry.Fans of T-Pain will find that his fifth go-around is a quality cure for their six-year itch.</p><p>One thing can be said for the rapper/singer: he never under-delivers — even if the expectation is for him to totally drop a masterpiece onto the world.</p></div>
