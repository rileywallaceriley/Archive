  <h1>Souled over sold: The Black Eyed Peas Are More Hip-Hop Than You Remember</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Success is a one-way street.</p><p>The hip-hop world is an unforgiving beast.</p><p>It's almost as though once you pop , any "hip-hop cred" goes out the window.</p><p>Such is the case with Black Eyed Peas, arguably one of the more successful, polished – and currently active – "hip-pop" crossover groups of the past...</p><p>Well, ever really.</p><p>Their audience, though, is far from the backpacker crowd you may find at your local club catching a performance from the likes Joey Badass.</p><p>Not these days anyways.</p><p>This wasn't always the case.</p><p>In case you forgot (and you're not alone), or too young to recall the scene at the time, I thought it would be good to take a BEP "refresher".</p><p>Will.I.am and Apl.De.Ap met in '88, and started to write and perform.</p><p>Before long, joined by a friend named Dante Santiago, and the trio were signing their first deal.</p><p>After grabbing the attention of Jerry Hellar's nephew, who promptly facilitated a contract with Eazy E's Ruthless Records under the name ATBAN Klann (or A Tribe Beyond a Nation).

Their first album <i><a href=" was completed, but ultimately shelved when Easy-E passed away from complications related to AIDS a short month after his diagnosis in 1995.</p><p>The guys dusted themselves off, replaced their pal Dante with rapper Taboo, and changed their name to the more familiar iteration we all know today.</p><p>With the new trio in place, they began to work on their brilliant, critically acclaimed official (Interscope Records) debut album, <i><a href=" The Front</a></i>.</p><p>It was conscious, live – quite literally – and admirably self-aware.</p><p>In the (commercial) hip-hop climate of 1997, especially in LA amongst a sea of gangsta music, it was a breath of fresh air.</p><p>The album spawned hits like <i><a href="https://youtu.be/-IdctSYjfpQ">Fallin Up</a></i> and <i><a href="https://youtu.be/Rdg1_EMlclo">Joints &amp; Jams</a></i>.</p><p>This led to a second album, <i><a href=" The Gap</a></i>, which followed much of the same "style guide", so to speak.</p><p>Their next move was the introduction of Fergie, which dramatically shifted their sound, audience and tax brackets.</p><p>Their third album, <em>Elephunk</em>, was the re-birth of BEP – the one that most parents and people born after 1991 will remember.

I think it's important to acknowledge the sans-Fergie trio.</p><p>Why they aren't mentioned in the same vein as someone like the roots is beyond me.</p><p>As far as hip-hop bands go, BEP's Behind The Front is a gem that holds up unbelievably well!</p><p>So take a moment, or two, and explore their older catalogue.</p><p>We've taken the liberty of cooking up a mix for you to get you started.</p><p>Do your homework.
