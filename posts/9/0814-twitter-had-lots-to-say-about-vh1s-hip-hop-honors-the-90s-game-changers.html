  <h1>Twitter Had Lots To Say About VH1's "Hip Hop Honors: The 90's Game Changers"</h1>
  <div class="meta">2017-09-19 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Last night's (September 18) broadcast of VH1 Hip Hop Honors paid homage to some of the biggest and brightest names in the history of Hip Hop.</p><p>This year, for its ninth iteration, the program paid particular attention to '90s Hip Hop and R&B.There were many notable moments that made for an amazing viewing experience for anyone who has memories rooted in the iconic period of the culture.</p><p>Naturally, Twitter was elated.Missy Elliott, who was previously honored in both 2007 and 2016, opened the show with a performance that lived up to the level of visual spectacle that made her such a pillar in the game.</p><p>Fans loved it.Jermaine Dupri and Master P were honored together with a medley that included renditions of "I Got The Hook Up" by P's son Romeo and "Just Kickin' It" by Xscape.</p><p>Afterward, the two music moguls delivered speeches on their accomplishments that focused on inspiring the next generation of artists.Many viewers pointed out that their monumental careers deserved separate nods, but they already received such recognition back in 2010 during a southern-focused edition of Hip Hop Honors that also paid tribute to Uncle Luke and Timbaland among others.Mariah Carey, one of the biggest stars of the '90s, was also honored.</p><p>Her performance of "Honey" seemed to be one of the most talked about performances of the evening -- despite what some pointed out as "stiffness" on her part. "Mariah was the innovator of the sound you hear now," Jermaine Dupri said in the tribute video.Before introducing an emotional (if you're over 30) montage of incredible game-changing visuals by legendary video producer Hype Williams, Pharrell delivered a heartfelt message about the current racial tensions boiling over in the U.S.Other standout moments included a tribute to Prodigy by Havoc, Fabolous, and Lil Kim; Teyana Taylor hitting more cues with a broken foot than some of us can hit without one; a special homage to the influential TV show Martin;and a medley of '90s hits including a Big Pun tribute by Fat Joe and Remy Ma.One consistent observation, though, seemed to be the age of the audience, who seemed unimpressed by many of the evening's bigger moments.</p><p>This appears to be a persistent issue with these ceremonies and Twitter wasn't pleased.Some viewers also pointed out that the show seemed to have a short runtime, which led to some songs being altered and rushed.All in all, audiences seemed to enjoy what they saw.</p><p>If you missed it, you can catch all the best moments on VH1's website.</p></div>
