  <h1>A Conversation With Rock (Of Heltah Skeltah)</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>When talking about group dynamics, people like to point towards Wu-Tang Clan as the quintessential example of a hip-hop dynasty; however, that's not entirely accurate.</p><p>It's impossible to have such a conversation and negate the influence of the Boot Camp Click.</p><p>They were a super-group composed of inner groups: Black Moon, OGC, Smiff-N-Wessun, and one of my fave groups, Heltah Skeltah.
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Heltah Skeltah, a duo composed of Rock and Ruck (Sean Price), came into notoriety when they dropped their classic debut <em><a href=" It contained a few of my fav tracks of the era, namely "Therapy" and "Operation Lockdown." As a group, they released three albums total – the aforementioned, <em><a href=" Force</a></em> and <em><a href=" ( Da Incredible Rap Team) – amidst a sea of collaborations, turmoil, and a brief split.</span></p>
<p class="p1">A few weeks ago, the hip-hop world was rocked by the unexpected death of Sean Price.</p><p>Word spread quickly, and outpouring of grief, and dazed memorial set timelines on fire.</p><p>His influence, and genuine respect among his peers – and fans alike – was apparent.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I decided to reach out to Sean's longtime partner in Rhyme to discuss his music, Heltah Skeltah, and the legacy Sean P leaves behind. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Peep the interview below.</span></p>


<strong>How did you get hip-hop?</strong>

Well, Beatboxing, and Roxanne Roxanne.</p><p>Honestly, in its earlier days, when it was still a relatively small community, I was younger and wasn't that into it; but, when I heard Roxanne Roxanne, that's when I started writing.</p><p>I wrote my first rap during that period.

<strong>How did you get into the game?</strong>

Well, I got lucky.</p><p>I had friends that did a lot of the hard work – I just got to have fun.</p><p>I just had to rap.</p><p>Steele from Smiff N' Wessun, he was the hardest worker.</p><p>He used to hang out and do all types of fuckery with us on the street, and also went to school and worked a job to pay for studio time.</p><p>So really, I got lucky...</p><p>I came in the game on the strength of my mans and them.



<strong>How had you initially met Sean Price?</strong>

I don't know; our mothers knew each other.</p><p>My earliest memory of him was at his 11th birthday party.</p><p>It was his surprise birthday party, and he already had a job at that point.

<strong>At what stage did you decide to come together as a duo – at what stage did you decide to become Heltah Skeltah?</strong>

We agreed to that over the phone when I got locked up in 1992.</p><p>But, I had already known for a while that was what I wanted to do.</p><p>Once I heard son get busy, and I saw his abilities and all that , I knew I wanted him to be my partner.</p><p>It was just a matter of playing my cards right, feeling out the situation and making it happen.

<strong>What was the process of recording Nocturnal?</strong>

There were a lot of late nights.</p><p>A lot of dudes, a lot of cigars, a lot of vegetables, and a lot of jokes.</p><p>There were some women around – but not too many.</p><p>There were also a lot of snacks around.</p><p>Mad cookies and cakes, and a lot of greenery.

<strong>You guys appeared to break up after your second album, <em>Magnum Force</em>.</p><p>What was the reason?</p><p>Was there any animosity?</strong>

Nah, We didn’t break up.</p><p>I just left Duck Down.</p><p>We were just on two different pages at that particular point in time.</p><p>Son was trying to do one thing, and I was attempting to do another; although, Heltah Skeltah was still intact.</p><p>I was on his  first solo album.</p><p>For all the time that I wasn’t with Duck Down and cats was saying that we had supposedly broken up… Yeah, I split with Duck Down, but I didn’t split with the Boot Camp.</p><p>Duck Down just happens to be Dru Ha and Buckshot’s company, so it’s tricky.</p><p>But it wasn’t that serious on a Heltah Skeltah level.

<strong>What made you guys get back together to do the <em>D.I.R.T</em> album?</strong>

We felt like it was time.</p><p>It wasn't that complicated.</p><p>Everything was rapid-fire, and back to back.</p><p>Ruck  dropped Monkey Bars; Smiff N Wessun dropped Reloaded, and Buckshot and 9th Wonder dropped Chemistry.</p><p>Then we were out touring the Last Stand .</p><p>It was in full swing.</p><p>So while people were like "oh shit, Rock is back?" We were already albums deep.</p><p>We had bullets in the chamber.</p><p>We also recorded Casualties of War  during that period.</p><p>So at that point, all of the disagreements I'd had with Duck Down had been hashed out, and we were all in.</p><p>By the time we did D.I.R.T, it was just a matter of asking "are you guys ready?"

<strong>What are you working on now?</strong>

I'm working on a bunch of shit.</p><p>My solo album, for one.</p><p>I've been working on it for a while now, but you know...</p><p>Situations change, the sounds change, my ears change, and the message I may be trying to give the people may change.</p><p>The album is in the process.</p><p>Life happens though, and right now.</p><p>I just lost the Yin to my Yang ...</p><p>My brother just died.</p><p>So, there are changes that need to happen on my album now.

<strong>What are some of your fondest memories of Sean Price?</strong>

Just knowing him, just having the privilege to be chosen to be that nigga's partner  – that's bigger than anything else.</p><p>He was a one of a kind, unique soul.</p><p>You don't just find an energy like his anywhere.</p><p>As unique as we all are as human beings, I mean, you may find somebody else at some point that reminds you of me, but you won't find anyone that reminds you of him.</p><p>He was one of one – and he chose me.</p><p>I mean, I tricked him into accepting me, but he chose me!

<strong>What would you want the world to know about Sean Price?</strong>

Everything I just said.</p><p>When I say he was special, I mean that.</p><p>I want them to listen to his catalog – and his jokes, his vulgarities and all his slap the shit out you isms, and enjoy all of it.</p><p>He epitomized the term not giving a fuck – and being yourself in the truest form.</p><p>Always telling the truth is a part of being yourself, but with him, it was a bit more complicated.</p><p>If he felt like lying to you, he would.</p><p>He didn't give a fuck about your rules.</p><p>He would say what I was thinking.</p><p>Shit that you were scared to say, he'd say – no problem.</p><p>On top of all that, he was a great father and a wonderful husband.</p><p>He was proud to be married.</p><p>He wasn't one of these cats out here who's married acting like they aren't married – running around in videos and misleading the public.</p><p>I mean, I get the look, but I also understand the subliminal messages we send to people through our music – and videos.</p><p>We're all programmed by what we see.</p><p>I mean, there's a nigga named Rambo in every hood  ...</p><p>Where did we get that from?</p><p>That's the kind of stuff that came from our programming, things that were always pushed into our faces.</p><p>Our whole lives.</p><p>A vast majority of the punchlines that most rappers have were influenced by movies and TV.

<strong>We're shaped by what we see.</strong>

The right wingers always want to come down on rappers for the messages we share, and the impact we have on the youth.</p><p>I said it on wax: "We influence the kids – but who influences the rappers?" Biggie Smalls called himself Frank White.</p><p>Where'd he get that from?</p><p>They don't want to talk about that.</p><p>When Biggie Small died, how old was he?

<strong>26, I believe.</p><p>I remember being young and thinking he was a grown man...</p><p>But in hindsight, he was young!</strong>

That's exactly where I was going with this...</p><p>I mean when you look back on it what, 15 years later, and you realize he was just 25–26...</p><p>He was a fucking kid!</p><p>All the hardest rappers out there were just kids.</p><p>We were all young minds, still susceptible to peer pressure, and influence.</p><p>If you're in the NBA, those dudes protect your ass.</p><p>Even if you're in your 30's, you still a system around designed to keep you straight.</p><p>But not for us.</p><p>We had to learn on our own.</p><p>I have been around the world, and I learned: fuck all this imagery.</p><p>That dude Sean Price took his wife everywhere – if he could take her, he took her.</p><p>He rapped about her on half of his songs, and he's got like 1000 songs.</p><p>That type of thing speaks volumes.</p><p>Very few of us out here are being our authentic selves.

<strong>And as well, the outpour of love and support he received worldwide speaks volumes to the impact he had on people's lives.</strong>

Word.</p><p>He was a magnetic dude.</p><p>A fucking comedian.</p><p>He's legitimately one of the funniest people you'd ever meet – and he'd smack the shit out you.</p><p>I just love that combination.

<strong>That's an excellent combination.</strong>

That's what I want the world to know about him...</p><p>But really, the world probably already knows that.</p><p>All they got to do is listen to one of his records.</p><p>You'll probably hear him mention his wife; you'll probably hear him shout out his daughter; actually, you for sure will.</p><p>He always mentions himself, and he named his daughter Shaun Price – so he legitimately says her name in every song.</p><p>So her name will be immortalized.</p><p>He did that for her, or maybe for him, but that's that, he mentions her name in every song.</p><p>You'll hear everything I just said.</p><p>So in a sense, I could've just said, "play one of his records." Because it's all him – through and through.</p><p>Even when he's saying some weird shit that you know couldn't have happened in real life, it's still him.
