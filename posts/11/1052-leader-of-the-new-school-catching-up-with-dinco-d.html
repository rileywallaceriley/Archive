  <h1>Leader of the New School: Catching Up With Dinco D</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sun, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Being in a group isn't easy, and there are plenty of examples of how complex the dynamic can be.</p><p>Whether it's animosity towards one member, who gets more spotlight, à la Method Man, or an awkward love triangle like City High.</p><p>Money can – and usually does – change everything.</p><p>When it comes to golden era groups, it's hard to ignore the imminent rise of Leaders Of The New School.</p><p>The trio, which consisted of members Charlie Brown, Dinco D and Busta Rhymes came to prominence after their classic appearance on Tribe Called Quests' <i>Scenario.</i> However, behind the scenes – and in one case in front of cameras – the group seemed to begin unraveling almost immediately.</p><p>The group left behind two notable albums and was the springboard for Busta's rise into the realm of rap's elite.</p><p>Last week, I caught up with 1/3 of the group Dinco D. He shared some insight on the group's break-up, what came next for him and his upcoming album with original Tribe Called Quest member Jarobi.

<b>How did you initially get involved in hip-hop?</b>

Growing up in NY, it was all around me.</p><p>Plus, my brother Jazz had a DJ crew – so I would go through all his records and play with his equipment.

<b>How did you meet Charlie and Busta?</b>

We grew up in the same neighborhood and went to the same school.</p><p>Brown introduced me to Busta and wanted to form a group.</p><p>So we begin writing and performing together.</p><p>The rest is history.

<b>Busta said in an interview with Vlad that he almost left the group before the first album.</p><p>What was the dynamic like in the group right before it took off?</b>

He was doing his own thing for a minute and was neglecting what we were building.</p><p>He would miss important meetings, and not put effort into us as a “group” – so understandably it was a bit frustrating.

<b>What caused the group to split up?</b>

It was a combination of outside forces and inside forces.</p><p>You could see people were helping Busta do his own thing, and not supporting Leaders of the New School as a unit.</p><p>Brown took it hard, cause he formed the group.</p><p>We worked hard as youngsters to make our dreams a reality, so to have it dismantled quicker than it took us to make it happen was stressful.

<b>Tell us about Dinco after LOTNS.</p><p>What came next for you?</b>

Well, I moved to ATL.</p><p>I was promoting parties and working with artists down there.</p><p>It was a whole different vibe at that point in history; Jermaine Dupri was blowing with So So Def, and Laface –with Dallas Austin and Outkast – was on the rise.</p><p>They had their families and weren't supporting NY artists that much.</p><p>So, I came back home and started producing again with my brothers Shamello and Buddha (who made Put Your Hands Where Your Eyes Can See for Busta).</p><p>We did songs for Mc Lyte, Zhané, Pharcyde and couple other artists.</p><p>We also did scoring for some films.

<b>Can you tell us about the collaborative project you and Jarobi are working on?</b>

Its called the Leaders Quest Mission, a project we have been brewing for the past year or so.</p><p>We've always been around each other, and recently started doing songs; it was very organic.</p><p>It's started sounding better and better, so we decided to make it a full LP.

<b>What else have you been working on lately?</b>

I have a single called "MeUwe" coming out with a band called Shinobi Ninja, and a solo project as well.</p><p>Plus I have some new artists I'm pushing, one of which is Bigg East from Long Island.</p><p>Also, I do a regular party called Party Flavors (which is a collaboration with Jarobi), and some product branding.</p><p>I stay busy.

<b>You came up in the golden era, what’s your take on the current hip-hop scene?</b>

It's cool, not as enjoyable as I wish it were, though.</p><p>There's so much repetitiveness in terms of style/lyrics, and no real versatility.</p><p>Still, my heart is in hip hop, and it will never leave my body.</p><p>So I find something I like and support it as much as I can.

<b>Who are some of your fave artists out right now?</b>

A lot of unknown underground artists – and a select few established ones.</p><p>It goes up and down daily.</p><p>No one stands out as an innovative phenomenal mega star.

<b>Can you share one of your fave memories of LOTNS? </b>

The whole movement was incredible; from being on In Living Color, and Arsenio Hall on my birthday, to chilling with LL in LA.
