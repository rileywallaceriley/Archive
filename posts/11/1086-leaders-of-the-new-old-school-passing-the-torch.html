  <h1>Leaders of the New Old School: Passing The Torch</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><blockquote>"Waitin for my day to come, just give me the word..."

– Memphis Bleek, from the song <em><a href=" It Down</a>&amp;nbsp;(</em>on the album<em> Lifetime...</p><p>Vol 2).</em></blockquote>
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">The "next generation" of hip-hop has had more than a few waves over the years.</p><p>A great deal of under-twenty spit kickers prefer to hone their sound to match the dominant sound of the day – and who could blame them.</p><p>However, there are a lot of fresh faces popping up that have seemed to embrace the 90's era that many older fans hold dear to their hearts.</span>

The timing makes sense; if you were 20 something a backpack rocking, subway bomber knocking tapes you dubbed off Stretch &amp; Bobitto – and you happened to get a woman pregnant – your offspring is now 15–18.</p><p>It's unlikely that you taught them about anything except 90's hip hop, which helped them gain a different perspective than their peers on the culture as a whole.</p><p>The result?</p><p>Joey Badass, Astro, A-F-R-O, Bishop Nehru and youngest of the bunch, TJ Brown.</p><p>They are the new breed of cats, much in the same vein as Sheyheim, A+ and Chi Ali were all those years ago.</p><p>Unlike our heroes though, this new breed of rapper&amp;nbsp;– armed with golden era aesthetics and sensibilities – have a secret weapon: the internet and social media.</p><p>Joey Badass made <i>waves</i> (no pun intended) with his debut mixtape that caught the ears of heads like DJ Premier, and tastemakers a like.</p><p>Astro blasted off (again, no pun intended) after his run on X-Factor.</p><p>He’s since established his sound as unapologetically hip-hop.</p><p>A-F-R-O is the most hyped wonder kid of the moment, capturing the imaginations of legends in the game with his (almost) unbelievably captivating freestyle skills.</p><p>Literally, he had to prove himself.</p><p>Lastly, TJ Brown is a youngster whose been setting my timeline on fire over the past few weeks dropping bars on classic records, and causing many to declare, “hip-hop is truly alive.”

There will never be another golden era as we all remember it, but this new class of young artists seem poised to create a new golden era that will inspire a new-new generation of artists to keep the spirit of hip-hop (as a culture) alive.</p><p>Shout out to the parents doing the right thing, and the iconic figures in the game who are passing the torch, and knowledge, along to these young cats.</p><p>Here’s to another 40 years of real shit!</p></div>
