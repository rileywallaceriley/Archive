  <div class="content"><p>After Michael B. Jordan — star of Creed II — bragged about being able to hold his own against ex-champ Roy Jones Jr., it appears that the 49-year-old boxer wants all the smoke.https://youtu.be/RLIt-XQ7cRg“If Michael B. wants this real, contact Roy Jones Jr. and we’ll make it happen,” Jones said in a video posted by TMZ.To his credit, Jordan did concede that he’d have been a light snack for the former champ in his prime.</p><p>While the 31-year-old actor has been training several years for his role as Adonis Creed in the newest films in the Rocky/Creed franchise, Jones insists that even in his current state, winning would be no issue.“I know he can’t beat me still,” he explained. “I know he’s probably in better condition because he’s younger… but I’m an old school vet.”The veteran boxer added that he’d be ready for the fight with only four or five weeks of training.</p><p>The ball is in Jordan’s court.</p></div>
