  <h1>Jim Jones Blesses Harlem With Max B Collaborations</h1>
  <div class="meta">2018-12-03 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>The decade-long beef between currently incarcerated rapper Max B and Harlem Diplomat Jim Jones was — until recently — one most thought would last forever.</p><p>When once asked what it would take to mend the rift by The Come Up DVD, Max B (jokingly?) said that “Somebody would have to die.” Jones echoed a similar sentiment noting in a 2017 interview “You violate me a certain type of way, that's for life.”Well, it appears that much of that animosity has subsided — from Jones’ perspective, anyway.</p><p>During a Thanksgiving weekend concert that took place on November 23 (the same event where Juelz Santana proposed to his longtime girlfriend), the rapper ran through a concise tribute set that included some of his most beloved collaborations with Biggavelli, including “G’s Up.”In a jail interview back in 2013, Max explained that his problems with Jones mainly stemmed from improper money management and the Byrdgang's general seniority system.“Why when I go perform at a show, and you makin' excess amount of dollars, you makin'  how the fuck is you givin' me $300?</p><p>I'm doin' eight, nine fucking records!</p><p>I'm out here sweatin' too,” Max stated.Their beef got deep, very disrespectful, and spilled over outside of records.</p><p>But, with Max coming home anytime now, allegedly, and this latest show of good faith by Jones, perhaps it’s all water under the bridge.</p></div>
