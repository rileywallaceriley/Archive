The song is about anyone that ever told you that you couldn't do something or that you couldn't accomplish your dreams ...  you can't go after what you believe in.</p><p>This is a big fuck you," he explains.

"I was working really hard on things and I was sort of in a place where I had no choice but to wait for something to happen ...</p><p>I was in a funk," he said of the song's creative inception.</p><p>Currently in the Los Angeles putting the finishing touches on his new album, Koncept shares that he is planning to come out strong after the final three visuals in this latest run are released; his roll-out includes an Asian tour with Scoop DeVille that kicks off in November with stops in Korea, Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p><p>Intriguingly, he also describes plans for a collaborative project with the "Poetic Justice" producer.</p><p>Check out Koncept's "Fuck You Music" video, above.</p></div>
