<hr />

<strong>Introduce yourself.</strong>

I’m ‘Just Scribble’, a self taught artist from the UK.

<strong>How did you get into art?</strong>

Drawing is something I’ve been doing since the age of 2.</p><p>I continued to do it throughout my childhood, so there wasn’t any real moment I got into Art; it just naturally found me.

<strong>Can you tell us about the work you have on your Tumblr?</strong>

The work I have on my tumblr is a collection of drawings/paintings, mainly of Hip-Hop artists that have inspired me over the years.

<strong>Do you exhibit it?</strong>

Yeah, I’ve had my work exhibited in two galleries so far.</p><p>I’ve got another exhibition coming up this weekend.

<strong>Who was the first rapper to take notice of your work?</strong>

The first major rapper to take notice of my work was Rick Ross.</p><p>I was fairly new to twitter at the time, so I was just tweeting a bunch of my pieces on there.</p><p>I posted a drawing I did of Rick Ross, not expecting him to see it.</p><p>The next thing I knew, he retweeted the drawing and followed me.

<strong>What was that like?</strong>

That was a big moment for me.</p><p>From then on I began seeking the attention of bigger names within the Hip-Hop industry.

<strong>What are you currently working on now?</strong>

I’m not working on anything at the moment.</p><p>I only work when I’m inspired to create something, so right now I’m taking a break until I get hit with some inspiration.

<strong>What are your fave hip-hop albums right now?</strong>

I don’t have any current favourites in terms of albums right now.</p><p>A lot of what’s come out recently is good, but not mind blowing.</p><p>My favourite mixtape at the moment is Mick Jenkins – The Water.</p><p>That tape is deep.

<strong>Where can people see more of your work – and can they purchase it?</strong>

<strong>Anything else you'd like to share with our readers.</strong>
