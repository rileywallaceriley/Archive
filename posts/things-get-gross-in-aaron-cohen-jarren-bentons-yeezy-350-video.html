<p>We both don’t give a shit about trends We also just get along well as human beings. We’re both dedicated to our craft, and neither of us are pretentious egomaniacs ... [we also] share a manager now, Max Alcabes, which makes working together even easier.”Stream the “Yeezy 350" video above.</p></div>
