  <h1>Matthew Daniels: Hip-Hop by the Numbers</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><blockquote>"This is not a serious academic study.</p><p>This is an, like, 'I thought it'd be cool on the Internet ..."

– Matt Daniels, in a interview with NPR.</blockquote>
Meet <a href="http://www.mdaniels.com/">Matthew Daniels</a> – a New York based designer, data scientist and hip-hop head.</p><p>Also, he's possibly the coolest guy ever, and I'm personally obsessed with his hip-hop focused research.</p><p>The sheer detail of his work is amazingly entertaining to explore.</p><p>He originally came to my attention when I was perusing Reddit and stumbled upon his <a href="http://mfdaniels.tumblr.com/post/93313634355/updated-rappers-sorted-by-size-of-vocabulary-20">hip-hop vocabulary project</a>.</p><p>Essentially he analyzed the first 35,000 lyrics of various American hip-hop artists and established a hierarchy based on the artists use of varying vocabulary that sparked much conversation – and debate.</p><p>There were a few surprises, and a few confirmations (like DMX having the lowest vocabulary of those analyzed).</p><p>Some artists, such as Biggie Smalls, weren't able to be analyzed, as they didn't have enough recorded material.

I asked Matt how he conceived this<em> insanely</em> interesting concept:

"This was orginally going to be a collaboration with another media company.</p><p>We were throwing around ideas, and this is the one we landed on.</p><p>I had been learning a python framework called <a href="https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nltk.org%2F&amp;ei=xWUVVfDZKMPwoASAhoGIDQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFAaOWlHZHy3sIDfIX4Hsc4O8s_aw&amp;sig2=3cosot549cawaE4pUvbUEQ&amp;bvm=bv.89381419,d.cGU">NLTK</a>, which is for language processing.</p><p>The first chapter of the manual for NLTK is on measuring the unique number of tokens (words) in a body of text.</p><p>I just adopted this approach for the hip hop lyrics data set."

Understandably this level of hip-hop nerdery broke the internet.</p><p>As Matt explained, "adding quantitative data to lyricism isn't common, so it was exciting to have this as a discussion point in hip hop.</p><p>The biggest surprises were that the data validated a lot of my assumptions: artists who were more experimental with their lyrics ended up using a wider vocabulary (e.g., Outkast)".</p><p>How do you top a project with this much cool factor?

<blockquote>"Producers understand the minutia – the exact note at the exact millisecond that creates an interesting beat.</p><p>I wish that more people understood this process and gift."</blockquote>
Matt's latest project is <a href="http://samplestitch.com/">Sample Stitch</a>, an interactive (responsive) web experience that allows users to recreate beats by Dilla, Kanye and 9th Wonder using all the original elements.</p><p>He's broken the songs into individual samples, and assigned all the samples to different keyboard keys.</p><p>Essentially this allows users to use their keyboards like a classic MPC.</p><p>The result?</p><p>A new found appreciation for the difficulty, and intricacy of<i> legit </i>hip-hop production.</p><p>What inspired this project?</p><p>Matt explains: "there was this project called <a href="https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.patatap.com%2F&amp;ei=T1sVVdGNM5OwogTnwIG4DQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNF0G7sug1rJBtmZ5YnpfLVxkZ1HmQ&amp;sig2=Ngmx4u96bhGAJWBKxeUFBQ&amp;bvm=bv.89381419,d.cGU">Patatap</a> that used a computer keyboard to trigger sounds.</p><p>I thought that this was genius because a computer keyboard is a native instrument for most people - we can play it naturally in the same way a musician approaches a piano."

It's sheer dopeness hasn't gone unnoticed.

That's just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>His other work includes an in depth look at the <a href="http://www.mdaniels.com/outkast">cultural influence and nuances of Outkast</a>, and historic<a href="http://www.mdaniels.com/shorty"> analysis of the use of the word "Shorty" </a>– and both are must-reads for any real hip-hop head.</p><p>When talking to Noisy (re: Sample Stitch) Matt explained that he was, bottom line, trying to "<em>break the Internet again</em>".</p><p>With this level of ingenuity, I doubt this is the last time that he'll do just that!</p><p>If you have yet to explore his work, be sure to <a href="http://www.mdaniels.com/">visit his web-site</a>.</p></div>
