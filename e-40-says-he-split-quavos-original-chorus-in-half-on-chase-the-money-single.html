    <div class="content"><p>KXNG Crooked recently spoke with Bay Area legend E-40 for the latest episode of HipHopDX's series Crook’s Corner. During the conversation, 40 Water explained how Quavo was originally meant to do a solo hook on the Practice Makes Paper single “Chase The Money” featuring ScHoolboy Q, A$AP Ferg and Roddy Ricch.“Everybody that I had get on the album, I waited for patiently," 40 noted. "Some sent [verses] back with the hurry ... some sent it back in a timely matter.</p>
<p>Some people sent it back months later."The least timely of the bunch was Quavo, whose hook needed to be split in half.“I split it in half 'cause I already had Roddy Ricch on there,” 40 said. “I didn't get [Quavo’s] eight-bar hook for months.”https://youtu.be/_rQ6bmLHkBgQuavo had a good reason for the delay though."He was on tour with Drake," 40 recalled. "They were on tour forever ... you can't get mad at somebody gettin’ the Gouda man.”The OG more than understood and was willing to wait, especially considering the past success he’s had working with Migos. 40 previously teamed up with Quavo and the other members on the “Choices (Yup)” remix with Rick Ross.Check out the entire episode of Crook's Corner here.[apple_news_ad type="any"]</p></div>
