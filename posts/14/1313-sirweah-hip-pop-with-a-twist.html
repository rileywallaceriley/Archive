  <h1>Sirweah: Hip-Pop With A Twist</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Oso Major, home to artist Legend--who we've featured a few times now--recently hit us up with their latest artist, Sirweah.</p><p>With a cadence that almost resembles J Cole, the young artist isn't married to hip-hop exclusively and dabbles in a sound that more accurately resembles 'hip-pop,' although he has bars .</p><p>This loose allegiance to one particular sound not only paints a picture of him as a real artist but also makes his catalog of music currently available deliciously eclectic; an example of this is his unique spin on Jason Chen's acoustic version of "Photograph."

"For me, it's never been about proving myself the best rapper or vocalist; there's always going to be someone who has me beat at that," he points out. "If I could, however, give the best feeling to a listener with just one song, then I feel like I've succeeded.</p><p>That's what my music has always been about; making people feel, and giving them hope from those emotions."

His latest record, "Everybody Knows," is a piano-driven, radio-ready single that helps to establish his sound as established; with a catchy sing-song hook and an undertone of 'look at me I made it,' the record has legs.</p><p>You can grab it now on iTunes.</p><p>Check out some of his music below.</p></div>
