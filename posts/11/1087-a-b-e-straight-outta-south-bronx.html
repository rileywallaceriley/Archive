  <h1>A-B-E: Straight Outta South Bronx</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><blockquote>My life was and still is far from perfect, trying’ to dissect myself as a wordsmith; to better understand why and where the hurt is, so you know you ain’t alone through my verses.

– A-B-E</blockquote>
One persistent sentiment seems to linger among "real" hip-hop heads these days: you need to have rap 'credibility'.</p><p>This grading system, though, has always had a flaw.</p><p>It largely ignores the sheer amount of first-hand experience that one may possess – even without doing anything in particular.</p><p>It also ignores the power of an average man.</p><p>Not all rappers are trap dwelling hot-heads ready to pop-off at the first sign of beef.</p><p>Some are just regular Joes, like you and me, with a unique ability to make relatable "reality-based" music that isn't forced or contrived.</p><p>I'm <i>constantly</i> hunting for such artists.</p><p>Meet A-B-E, also known as Abe the Profit.</p><p>Coming straight out of the South Bronx, he was inspired by hip-hop culture and began beatboxing and rapping at a young age.</p><p>He doesn't quite fit the mould of the average NYC spit kicker.</p><p>He's mad educated, having earned his B.Sc. and M.A. at New York University.</p><p>He's a published poet, has shared the stage with Harry Belafonte, Rosario Dawson, Dr.</p><p>Cornel West, Rosie Perez, and others.</p><p>Impressive right?</p><p>He's an activist, educator and speaker – and has performed/toured all over the world in the name of hip-hop.</p><p>He recently released what he describes as his "labor of love", <i>A South Bronx Tale LP</i>.</p><p>You can hear the work A-B-E's put into this project.</p><p>It has great sonic appeal and traverses a plethora of subject matter, some of which is unique on the NYC scene.

<i>Disconnected Youth</i>, for example, tells the tale of a young outsider, which I'm sure lots of youth can relate to. <i>Real With Yourself</i>, talks about the woes of the 9-5 struggle, but stresses the importance of staying true to your personal goals and dreams.</p><p>The super deep <i>If I Should Die Tonight</i> is an open (final) letter to his loved ones and detractors.</p><p>On the track <i>This Is For The Kids</i>, he plays the role of a too real for TV substitute teacher:

<i>"Christopher Columbus ain't discover America; he killed Indians – he’s a masked murderer!"</i>

The real gems – for me anyways – comes at the tail end of the album.</p><p>The relationship-themed <i>Work It Out</i>, the sexy <i>Chocolate Pomegranate</i>, the sax-driven <i>Speak My Truth</i> are must-bumps.</p><p>Although his background may not what some of the more 'trap-aholic' heads today are checking for, it's definitely what they <i>need</i>.</p><p>With a cadence that almost puts me in mind of Immortal Technique, and a very clever song writing style, A-B-E delivers a solid debut solo.</p><p>I'd love to see him speak live one day – he comes across as someone with a lot to say!
