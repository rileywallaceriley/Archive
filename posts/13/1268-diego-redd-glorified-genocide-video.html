--Diego Redd</blockquote>
Hip-hop recording artist Diego Redd returns with the first visual from his new album, "Glorified Genocide." What he describes as a "breaking down the glorification of our devastation over a soulful beat," title track from the former DefJam recording artist delivers a bar heavy, thought-provoking look at the realities of life as an African American in today's  society.</p><p>The high quality visual itself is depicts the rapper in the back of a cop car, and being involved in an altercation that's become common ground in today's media; eventually, though, the tables turn, with the officer on his knees with his hands up.</p><p>Throughout his career, he's had a co-sign from super star Kanye West and has worked with West Coast legends like E-40, WC (Westside Connection), and more.</p><p>He's currently on tour -- so, you can check his Instagram and Twitter for updates.
