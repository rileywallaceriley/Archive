  <div class="content"><p>As the Toronto Raptors prepare to host the Golden State Warriors for Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday (May 30), it appears as though the team’s biggest fan, Drake, may have to turn his obvious enthusiasm down a notch.</p><p>A new report by ESPN says that a league spokesperson as spoken to the Raptors about their team ambassador’s sideline antics during the Eastern Conference Finals.Drake has been on heavy troll duty thus far in the playoffs, but when he walked on the court during Game 4 and rubbed Raptor’s head coach Nick Nurse’s shoulders during Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals, many thought he might have gone too far."There's certainly no place  for fans and, you know, whatever it is exactly that Drake is for the Toronto Raptors,” Milwaukee Bucks head coach Mike Budenholzer told ESPN.Still, many are taking Drizzy’s often animated presence in jest; even Nurse seems to be shrugging off outrage, as he and Drake humorously reenacted the infamous shoulder rub after the Rap’s historic Game 6 win.Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr says he thinks it’s fun — adding that Drake will have some competition for most team spirit, noting: “We got E-40 ready for them ... we're in good shape.”So it seems that some fans calling for Drake to sit down and watch may come at least partially get their wish, with his sideline presence being more subdued, like Game 6 where he came dressed as Birdie from Above The Rim.“He's having fun, having -- you can't hate on nobody having fun,” Warrior’s point guard Stephen Curry adds. ”I guess in this life everybody hates on people having fun.</p><p>So it's par for the course on that one."</p></div>
