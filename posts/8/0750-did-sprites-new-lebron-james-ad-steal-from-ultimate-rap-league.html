  <div class="content"><p>Coca-Cola has unveiled a new Sprite campaign starring LeBron James and Oakland MC Kamaiyah.</p><p>While the ad itself may be refreshing, there is one element that feels very familiar, as pointed out by Ultimate Rap League founder Smack White.The ad, ​developed and created by Wieden + Kennedy New York, features James as pitcher Big Taste and Kamaiyah as the catcher.</p><p>As it wraps, we hear Sprite's new "Sprrrrrrrrite" tag, which according to White sounds a lot like his infamous ​"smmmddddaaack" tagline that dates back to his infamous street DVD series, SMACK.“I want my coins Sprite," White wrote in an Instagram caption. "At least think about sponsoring an event!</p><p>Grow the Culture."​SMACK, which stands for streets, music, arts, culture, knowledge, was one of the first ​outlets to adopt and popularize the raw, acapella battle rap format that's standard fare across all present era battle rap leagues.Battle rap fans are bothered by the oversight from a brand which — throughout the years — has been respectful of the culture.But it seems like a boycott of the company by battle rap fans may not be necessary.</p><p>A rep for The Coca-Cola Company responded to HipHopDX and explained the campaign's inspiration on behalf of the creative team. "The audio tag is meant to be a play on an umpire yelling 'strike,'" they explained.</p></div>
