  <h1>Eminem Drops New “Camp Shady” Merch Line</h1>
  <div class="meta">2017-08-17 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Six days after initially teasing new merch via Instagram, Eminem dropped a limited run of "Camp Shady" t-shirts and accessories on Thursday (August 17) via the Shady Records online shop.As suggested by his blatantly photoshopped post, the merch is summer specific.</p><p>The "Camp Shady" items include a trucker hat, white bandana, canteen, mug, and two shirt colorways.The question remains whether this new collection is a clue about his upcoming project.As previously reported by HipHopDX, Em has been in the studio with rapper 2 Chainz, who talked about the experience with DJ Drama on Shady 45 Radio. "That's how I know I can rap," 2 Chainz told Drama when the topic came up.</p><p>Originally brought in for a chorus, he talked his way into a verse, which ended up sticking."It's for — he has a project coming up," 2 Chainz nonchalantly noted when asked what the song was for.https://youtu.be/vMiwFOL9qVQ?t=17m35sDr.</p><p>Dre was also reportedly working on a track for the project, which The Defiant Ones director Allen Hughes described as being "in the 11th hour."Whether Camp Shady is an actual working title for Marshall's upcoming ninth studio album or simply just a fun line of merch remains to be seen.Either way, are you coppin' or nah?</p></div>
