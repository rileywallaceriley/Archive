<p>Farrris traces the LP’s concept back to 7th grade, when a philosophy class ignited his love for complex problems and chess.</p><p>Around this time, he discovered The Riddler from <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em>.</p>

<p>So this journey starts back in the 7th grade for me.</p><p>As an elective class, I took "philosophy"…my brain enjoyed complex problems and things at a young age.</p><p>This is also around the time I first saw the "Batman animated series." I caught an episode featuring the Riddler and was intrigued by the riddles.</p><p>I would sit and try to solve them before Batman.</p>

<p>Farrris says life molded him into an enigmatic figure, always "thinking steps ahead and trying to see around corners before I bend them." This led to the album's title, a play on N.W.A.'s name:</p>

<p>"Which led me to the title Enigma With An Attitude.</p><p>A play on words 'Nigga With An Attitude' NWA, whose Ice Cube was the first rapper my uncle let me listen to."</p>

<p>Farrris says <em>Enigma With An Attitude</em> is filled with "thought-provoking lines and heavy play on the enigma" because he needs that intellectual challenge to keep his writing sharp.</p><p>He takes street narratives and philosophizes them through the prism of life's mysteries and complexities.</p>

<p>The album cover depicts Farrris as The Riddler alongside the Saw villain Jigsaw.</p><p>Farrris explains:</p>

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"This cover is me as the Riddler with a needle to Jigsaw, who is another enigma.</p><p>John Kramer as a painter.</p><p>A different approach, but still it forced you to think in a painful way."</p>
