  <h1>Writer Pokes Fun At Kanye West In Hilarious New Sci-Fi Screenplay</h1>
  <div class="meta">2018-04-26 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Kanye West has been driving a wedge between the left-wing and right-wing Twitter -- and among fans -- following a string of tweets that affirmed his support for Donald Trump.</p><p>As he has in the past with other topics, writer Jordan VanDina has attempted to rationalize Kanye's thought process, humorously casting him in his new screenplay, Space Force.The script follows Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, Lance Bass and West -- all assembled by Elon Musk -- to go into space and defeat Vladamir Putin, who has overthrown Trump and become the supreme ruler.</p><p>Along the way, there are a ton of Kanye-isms related to both his most recent Twitter activity and past missteps.There is even reference to the reoccurring fan debate about where The Life Of Pablo ranks among Yeezy's best album.Considering how heated some of the debate and discussion about West has become, it's not a bad thing to take a breather and see a little humor in it.Read the full script here.</p></div>
