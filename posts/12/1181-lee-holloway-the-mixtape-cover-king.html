  <h1>Lee Holloway: The Mixtape Cover King</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>While on the hunt for a digital artist to help him design a mixtape cover, entrepreneur Lee Holloway discovered a huge niche.</p><p>Many of the providers that existed in the market either used cheap looking templates or lacked the intimate knowledge to create credible urban artwork, which resulted in low-quality results.</p><p>Lee, better known as the Mixtape Cover King, began offering custom, one of a kind cover, and before long things took off, in a major way.</p><p>Once he had over 100 orders, he realized he needed to find a way to make this into a business that could help feed his family.</p><p>In 2012, Mixtape Cover King officially launched online and has since done notable covers for the likes of the dab-gods, Migos, Mr.</p><p>Never Tired, Kevin Gates, Twista, numerous Coast 2 Coast DJ's and much – much – more.</p><p>With a commercial on Vh1's signature urban series, Love &amp; Hip-Hop, to international acclaim, Lee and his team clearly have the game on lock; although, their breadth of offerings doesn't stop at mixtapes.</p><p>Take a look at the commercial/review below of the custom iced out jewellery you can have produced.</p><p>Bottom line, if you're an indie artist, you need to put your best foot forward.</p><p>Rather than suffer from lack of media due to poor graphics, why not let Lee and his team get you looking right for the summer.
