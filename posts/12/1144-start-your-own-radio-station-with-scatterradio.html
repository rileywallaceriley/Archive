  <div class="content"><p>Have you ever dreamed of starting your internet radio station?</p><p>Although you'd think that Internet technology would have made such a task incredibly easy, until late, it was quite cumbersome and expensive – almost unattainable by either those without a serious budget or above average computer skills.</p><p>Services like Shoutcast were not for novices on a broadcaster or listener side, and the logistics of streaming 24 hours were, well, hard to overcome.</p><p>That was then; this is now.</p><p>New service, <a href="http://ScatterRadio.com">ScatterRadio</a>, is allowing artists and wanna-be shock jocks the ability to start their free streaming radio station, and stream 24/7 via the web, or the ScatterRadio app.</p><p>As an artist you can stream your entire catalogue, as a company/brand, you could stream commercials or infomercials.</p><p>As a connoisseur with an awesome collection of music, you can simply play curator and share your playlist with the community.

<a href="http://ScatterRadio.com">ScatterRadio</a> is more than just a radio playing application, though, as it allows users to chat and discuss the topics and music being played on the various channels.</p><p>This could be an incredibly important feature and engagement measure for artists/labels looking for feedback on new/unsigned acts, or brands looking for feedback on products or services they're offering.</p><p>It truly is a platform for the people, by the people.</p><p>If you're an unsigned artist who doesn't have the time to put into creating your station, or you simply just want to get your name out there, ScatterRadio is also offering to play unsigned artists on their <a href="http://scatterradioblog.com/2016/01/28/newmusic-trending-now-on-scatterradio/">new/trending music channel</a>s.</p><p>That means you can send your music to ScatterRadio, as they curate channels specifically for new music the ranges from rock to hip-hop and rap.</p><p>So give ScatterRadio a try; if not to start your channel at first, at least, to take a listen to what other users are currently doing on the platform.</p></div>
