  <div class="meta">Mon, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Orcutt--California--producer <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/laid-back-soul-beats-by-tyrellevitiello/">TyrelleVitiello</a> has been dropping smooth hip-hop instrumentals into our inbox for a while now; we thought it was only right to help our super-dope readers learn a little bit more about the incredibly underrated beatmaker.</p><p>Check out the Q&amp;A below, and peep his work below.

<hr />

<strong>How did you get involved in music?
</strong>
I started making music as a kid, playing different percussion instruments and moved on from drums to drum pads early in high school.</p><p>My very closest friends and I, at the time, were just enjoying ourselves and made music for us to dig.</p><p>As things moved on it became much more than just a hobby, at least for some of us.

<strong>How would you describe it?
</strong>
My music is a very vibrational and melodic sort of hip-hop.</p><p>I like to refer to it as 'smooth-hop' in fact.</p><p>I focus on using soft and appealing samples, influenced by alot of jazz &amp; bossa nova, tied together with some 90's style drums.

<strong>Who are your influences?
</strong>
Regarding musical influences, artists like Yusef Lateef/ Mos Def / Marvin Gaye / Binary Star / Stan Getz / Astrud Gilberto &amp; and a ton of others to be honest.

<strong>What have you dropped so far?
</strong>
In the last year, I've probably had about 20 releases, 11 of which are still available online, and the most notable of which being my most recent release 'afthrs'.</p><p>It reached almost 13k plays in just a couple weeks and continues to attract new listeners.

Currently, I am working on putting together a tour!</p><p>The launch will be late March of 2017, but the details are on the DL as of now.</p><p>Very exciting.</p><p>Aside from that, I'll be releasing a beat tape entitled 'the rtrotape' this holiday season, and will be playing quite a few venues on the Central Coast between now and March.</p><p>To keep up with show dates, email-exclusive music, and things of the sort visit tyrellevitiellomusic.com

<strong>What's been your biggest achievement thus far?
</strong>
Some of my greatest achievements thus far would have to be the extent of my travels by this point.</p><p>I've had the opportunity to go to places in the world that I have always desired to, and involve my music career cohesively.</p><p>They--in fact--very much compliment one another, my desire and passion for producing and performing music, as well as my love of travel and experience.</p><p>I've worked with artists, collectives, and businesses from Baltimore to San Fransisco to Pensacola to Los Angeles.</p><p>Coffee houses in Atlanta, and art studios in Santa Barbara.</p><p>Collaboration is something I take pride in focusing on.

<strong>What's your biggest goal?
</strong>
A goal of mine right now is to play a roof-top show in Europe at sunset, very soon.</p><p>I am definitely working on making that happen.

<strong>What's Next?
</strong>
The release of '<em>the rtrotape</em>' just in time for the holidays, a full version of My Website will be up on January 1st--big day.</p><p>I'll be heading to Seattle January 28, so stay tuned on-line and perhaps catch me at a show!
