<p>"The song's focus was to highlight and represent beautiful women of all colors by describing them as flavors of ice cream," Rae laments. "The sound from the ice cream truck was a perfect way to put us in the pocket, and the hook really made it easy to attack the song."</p>

<p>Rae continues, "We needed something soft but heartfelt for the album.</p><p>I wanted to make sure women were incorporated in the concept, they played such a huge part in hip-hop culture…I had to make it happen."&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>McDaniels recalled his intention with the treatment, noting, "I wanted women to love the video. 'The Ice Cream man is coming' was the first thing that caught my ear.</p><p>We had to have a kid yelling that part, and the reference to the flavors.</p><p>Butter Pecan Rican, Chocolate Deluxe, French Vanilla and Caramel Sundae.</p><p>We had to have women that represented that complexion."</p>
