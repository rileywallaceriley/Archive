  <h1>Kaiju The Unconquerable Returns With A New Episode</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Kaiju The Unconquerable is one of those artists that fails to ever settle into anything — in the best way possible. “Episode 7: Ultraman” found it’s way to my inbox this past April, and I was amazed at how different Kaiju’s vibe was.</p><p>Jarring isn’t quite the right word, but the shift in tone from “<a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/indiespotliught-kaiju-the-unconquerable-release-new-short-film/">CYBERPUNK 2050</a>” to “<a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/kaiju-the-unconquerable-returns-with-ultraman-visual/">Ultraman</a>” should a to of range, with the quality of the video being the constant.</p><p>His latest is easily my fave release from him to date. “Episode 8: Got II,” also dubbed “Restoration Of Akumetsu,” sees Kaiju playing the role of a cyber vigilante/assassin who — we learn through the excellent long-form news intro — is slaughtering important officials, earning himself (by the end) $2 billion bounty.</p><p>As Akumetsu, donning a wild rad mask (who one newscaster described as exploding), he and his cohort Swisha take out a target and everyone in the way.</p><p>A highlight is right before he first enters the location and cuts off the security guard’s hand.</p><p>Much like his other pieces  — and kind of like “This Is America” by Childish Gambino — his visuals and songs can stand alone.</p><p>As a juxtaposition to the more easy-going “Ultraman,” which was in many ways more playful and littered with delicious nerd-centric references, Episode 8 is much more aggressive.</p><p>Upon first listen it was reminiscent of DMX’s aura on his debut record; specifically the chorus put me in mind of “Damian,” so seeing in the credits that it was in fact inspired by X was a neat addition on his part.

With a slow trappish instrumental, Kaiju’s flow is impeccable — at one point almost matching the cadence of Kendrick Lamar as he spits: “always intentional, my niggas keep it traditional, yeah you talking the fictional being my words to the physical ... black is beautiful, yeah my people nutritional, they try to kill us with chemicals, lord don’t make me get biblical.”

While staying to a similar format, Kaiju manages to continually reinvent his sound, making each piece of his puzzle fit together while also standing out from the crowd.</p><p>This latest chapter is no different; while I have no idea what this is building towards or the grand vision, I’m excited to see the wonders that Episode 9 holds!</p><p>Early.</p></div>
