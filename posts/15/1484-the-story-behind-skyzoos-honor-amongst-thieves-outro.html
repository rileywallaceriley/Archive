  <h1>The Story Behind Skyzoo’s “Honor Amongst Thieves” Outro</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>If you’ve slept on Skyzoo’s latest LP, <em>In Celebration Of Us</em>, then shame on you.</p><p>It’s masterpiece centered around equal parts social injustice and commentary, and — more endearing — fatherhood, and the role it played in his life.

One of the more compelling tracks, the outro “Honour Amongst Thieves,” features a lengthy live recording of Skyzoo telling the story of how his Father played a quintessential role in his early life; a story made all the more touching considering he is now a father.</p><p>As Skyzoo explains, the story itself just came to him. “It  a public access network in Brooklyn called BRIC TV.</p><p>I did a show with some people there,” he said. “They had this segment where it was storytellers ... they had people come in to tell a story, any story that they wanted to a crowd.</p><p>I was invited by a woman named Angela to be on that show.</p><p>It was me, and a bunch of other people and everyone told their story over the course of like five or 10 minutes.”

As Skyzoo explains, he showed up unprepared. “I had a lot going on, but I promised I would do it.</p><p>She's a great person.</p><p>So, I said, ‘Okay, let me do this,’ he says.

“I kind of didn't think of a story ahead of time.</p><p>I was ripping and running a lot.</p><p>So, when I got there and the clock was ticking.</p><p>It was like, ‘All right, this guy's up next.’ I'm thinking: ‘what the hell am I going to talk about?’ And, then, it just came.

“It came to me on the spot.</p><p>Once I did it, after the applause you hear and everything at the end,  it came out dope,” he said. “I asked the people at the network for the audio ...</p><p>I knew this would be fly to put on the album.”
