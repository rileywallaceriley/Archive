    <h1>Kanye West & Lil Pump Drop Pornhub Awards-Sanctioned “I Love It” Video</h1>
    <div class="meta">2018-09-07 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Last night (September 6) at the Porn Hub Awards, for which Kanye served as the creative director, Ye premiered a cartoonish new Spike Jonze visual for “I Love It” featuring Lil Pump. Also featuring comedienne Adele Givens, the video has Pump — who is apparently headed to jail — and Yeezy dropping explicit lyrics while walking around in oversized suits.</p>
<p>If ever porn stars needed a true Hip Hop anthem, “You’re such a fuckin’ hoe, I love it,” could be it.The video also provided some context for the hilarious oversized Yeezy slides that Kanye posted in response to his roasting for wearing slides that were too small.As Creative Director, Ye styled all of the presenter’s clothing, designed the actual awards for the show, which was hosted by porn star Asa Akira. He also joined opening performer Teyana Taylor on stage for a performance of “Hurry.”[apple_news_ad type="standard"]</p></div>
