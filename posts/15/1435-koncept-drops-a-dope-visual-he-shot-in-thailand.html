  <h1>Koncept Drops A Dope Visual He Shot In Thailand</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Brown Bag All-Stars member, and former Fat Beats NYC employee -- Queens rapper Koncept -- is one of those cats who I have supported, and will continue to support, from the jump.<a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/the-fuel-a-conversation-with-rapper-koncept/"> I had a great chat with him earlier on in my AAHH days</a>, and have been closely following his music ever since.</p><p>His latest chapter has been his most intriguing; he took what he thought was a two week trip to Seoul for a gig, spiraled into a series of gigs, which eventually resulted in him signing with Sony Asia.</p><p>Now -- currently living in Asia -- he's continuing promotion for his latest LP released on the Asian major-label,<em> 14 Hours Ahead</em>, with a gorgeous new visual for "Overboard," one the album's standouts.

"The music video was shot in Thailand on a boat between Pattaya and Kho Samed," Koncept explains. "Thailand is an amazing place.</p><p>I wanted the video to be simple and just have clear shots to show you how beautiful this world can be.</p><p>Being on a boat also fit the song title and theme perfectly."

As he goes on to describe, the track has a few meanings associated with it. "One  is an overreaction.</p><p>It is wise to think before making an action, or even speaking.</p><p>Sometimes without sitting back and evaluating a situation, people can react to something in the wrong way.</p><p>Our emotions are strong and can sometimes get the best of us making us act without taking a chance to breathe and think.</p><p>Therefore, going “overboard."
"Another meaning," he continues, "is when something or someone has just gone too far, and quite frankly, they need to be thrown “overboard ...</p><p>It's deciding that the relationship is no longer going to work out."
