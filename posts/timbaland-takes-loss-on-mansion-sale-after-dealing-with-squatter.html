    <h1>Timbaland Takes Loss On Mansion Sale After Dealing With Squatter</h1>
    <div class="meta">2019-03-01 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Timbaland has finally sold his 10,689 square foot Florida mansion following a year of dealing with a tenant from hell.According to The Blast, Timbo first purchased the property in 2004 for $3.4 million and put it up for sale back in 2017 following his split with his ex-wife Monique Mosley. The $4.49 million asking price kept declining as it became difficult to attract buyers.While awaiting a buyer, Timbo rented out the massive digs to a man named William Zamora.</p>
<p>Things went sour though, escalating to the point of a police intervention and lawsuit as Zamora refused to vacate the premises.Zamora, whose life was seemingly falling apart, allegedly caused over $100,000 in damages. Timbo is still attempting to recoup the money as part of his ex-tenant's ongoing bankruptcy case.New Era Investment Properties is the new owner of the property, purchasing it for only $1.8 million.</p>
<p>But, it sounds as though Timbaland is just happy to move on despite taking a $1.59 million loss.</p></div>
