  <h1>Eb&Flow: Keeping It Raw</h1>

  <div class="content"><p><blockquote>"My mind is open to a lot of good, and a lot of evil..."

– Eb&amp;Flow</blockquote>
As I've been very vocal about in the past, I'm obsessed with finding raw, untapped talent that exists across the interwebs, and showcasing them here on AAHIPHOP.</p><p>This week I have Eb&amp;Flow, a young cat from Cincinnati with an old soul.</p><p>Seriously, I'm often impressed with kids that have an old school aesthetic, but this kid damn near sounds like he's in the golden era.&amp;nbsp;

While reviewing the tracks he sent me, I was drawn to their basement demo-tape appeal that almost comes off as 'professionally amateur'.</p><p>It's quite reminiscent of the shit you may have heard on a late night mix with Stretch &amp; Bobbito back in 95'–96'.</p><p>He has grimy production, and above all bars to match.&amp;nbsp;

<i>"...that's ludicrous, not talking bout the side with them hits – I mean the stupidness when they assume they know what it is..."
</i>
<i>– Eb&amp;Flow from the track "Homies."</i>

Highly recommended listening is his ode to fake friends, <i>Homies</i>, and the laid back <i>She Always Askin'</i>.</p><p>Give the kid a spin, and if your feeling his first four joints, then I recommend you jamming his 8-song project, <i>King Goldirocks</i>, for a more cohesive experience.&amp;nbsp;
