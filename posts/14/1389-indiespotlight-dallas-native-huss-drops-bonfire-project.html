  <h1>#IndieSpotlight: Dallas Native Huss Drops Bonfire Project</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>25-year-old Dallas, Texas, based producer/artist Huss has been on our radar for a while now.</p><p>In fact, Magnetic Magazine included his track <em>#Bae</em> on their <a href="http://www.magneticmag.com/2015/04/top-10-tracks-that-describe-dallas/"> definitive "Dallas" </a>song list.</p><p>With influences from grungy rock, smooth R&amp;B, electro, jazz, and southern vibes combined, he has a unique sound.</p><p>He recently hit us off with <em>Bonfire</em>, his first full-length project.</p><p>At ten tracks in length, it's part beat tape, part self-help seminar, and part EP in one well-produced package.</p><p>A bulk of the tape is simply Instrumentals; there's the slow, grimy bass of "Jurassic," the more upbeat head nodding bounce of "Waves," and the electro/piano vibe of "META," which is emblazoned with a self-help monolog.</p><p>The tone of the latter is simple, "don't let dreams be dreams."

He does have guest vocals from the likes of SMOKESTKZ, Osiris Ruff, and BLXCK SINATRA (on two records).</p><p>While all of the songs with vocals are in the same pocket, they have completely different vibes.</p><p>The crown jewel, though, is BLXCK SINATRA's "Harmonic." The record's snapping drum pattern and the jazzy undertones make for an incredible vibe. "Life's a bitch, but she'll love you if you hit it right -- I did a lot of wrong, I been trying to get it right," raps BLXCK amid cool jazzy horns.</p><p>There is also an alternate version (from that on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/hussonthebeat/hu-x-blxck-sinatra-harmonic">SoundCloud</a>).</p><p>The YouTube version appears to have more contextual interludes making for a better listening experience -- not unlike the album mixes that J.Rocc provides for Dilla releases.</p><p>As well, the alternate sequencing seemed to make more sonic sense.</p><p>This project is made for long summer nights riding around with the windows down; if you're not up on Huss, give <em>Bonfire</em> a spin.</p><p>Adjust your bass accordingly.</p></div>
