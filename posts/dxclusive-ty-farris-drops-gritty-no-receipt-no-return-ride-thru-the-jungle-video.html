    <div class="content"><p>Fresh off the release of the third installment of his No Cosign Just Cocaine series, Detroit MC Ty Farris drops off a two-for-one visual for the Bozack Morris-produced singles “No Receipt, No Return” and “Ride Thru The Jungle.”Directed by Augustine Cruz for Envysion Entertainment, the video’s dark scenery and dramatic lighting capture the essence of Bozack’s gritty production.In a January 2020 interview with HipHopDX, Farris noted that the early feedback he’d received on his latest project was overwhelmingly positive.“The response from the people and the energy is amazing. I intended to end it here, to be honest, but I think I’ll listen to the people you know,” he said, adding that fans could see part four by the end of the year.Stream Ty Farris’ video for “No Receipt, No Return” above.No Cosign Just Cocaine Part 3 — featuring production by Stu Bangas, Bozack Morris, Sebb Bash and features from Flee Lord, Eto, MAV and Eddie Kaine — is available now.</p></div>
