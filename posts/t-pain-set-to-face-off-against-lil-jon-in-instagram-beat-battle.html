    <div class="content"><p>It appears that there was a method to the madness of swapping T-Pain in favor of Southern super-producer Mannie Fresh for the April 1 Instagram beat battle against Scott Storch.The “Buy You A Drank” singer/producer will now be facing off against multi-platinum producer Lil Jon on Saturday (April 4) at 9 PM EST. “This time, it’s for real,” T-Pain stated on Instagram. The most impressive thing is how quickly Timbaland and Swizz Beatz — curating the battles under the brand Verzuz — were able to pull the event together.</p>
<p>It’s a testament to how flexible the platform is, especially with logistics such as venues and ticketing removed from the equation.“Tim and Swizz hit me and said they were looking at comments and came to the fact that producer vs songwriter just doesn’t make sense,” T-Pain Tweeted April 1. “I didn’t back out lol I was ready to have fun on live shit. Its comin tho.”[related_article id="55109" type="news"]T-Pain — unbeknownst to many — was the producer behind the bulk of his biggest hits, as well as songs by Ciara, Jennifer Hudson, Chris Brown and more.</p>
<p>Lil Jon helped define the “crunk” sound, crafting chart-topping hits like Ciara’s “Goodies,” Usher’s “Yeah,” and many (many) more.This one should be interesting.https://youtu.be/dBrRBZy8OTshttps://youtu.be/GxBSyx85Kp8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-fL-vdcBWo[apple_news_ad type="standard”]</p></div>
