This time around, he's teamed up with Lyricist Lounge Alumni Wordsworth and Virginia upstart <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jacoblotto">Jacob Lotto</a>.</p><p>Lyricist Lounge was a legendary underground hip-hop showcase that grew from a humble beginning as an open mic showcase with relatively small audiences into a revered launchpad for some of the genre's brightest under the radar voices.</p><p>It also spawned a series of compilations and even a TV show.</p><p>Wordsworth, who notably appeared not only in the live showcase but also the MTV show, has also worked with artists like Mos Def and Talib Kweli (Blackstar), A Tribe Called Quest, and more.</p><p>So, it's a good look for Trew, who's features have been very impressive thus far.</p><p>Trew is currently working on a Hip-Hop/House project with Toronto DJ and producer Melanie Sutherland -- as well as eying a 2017 release date for his solo project.</p><p>In the meantime, check the new single!
