    <h1>J57 Asserts Himself As Both Producer & MC On New EP</h1>
    <div class="meta">2019-02-06 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>With his first release of 2019, Brown Bag AllStars alum J57 is aiming to shed his label as a beat maker, redefining himself as an artist. “This isn’t a producer project,” he tells HipHopDX of the four-song EP, Anti-Social Media — a surprise release and birthday gift to himself.Though the project is extremely eclectic, it’s still Hip Hop to the core. “I save the boom-bap style for my work with Jamo Gang, Brown Bag AllStars, and features,” he notes.“I used this project as a way for me to get my frustrations out,” he explains. Touching on the accessibility that comes with social media, and even themes of depression, the project offers a slice of personal truths.Ultimately, he hopes his openness will connect with those who struggle with the same hurdles. “I hope this project speaks to people that are like me ... and that it just plain entertains those that can’t relate.”Check out J57’s Anti-Social Matter, below.https://open.spotify.com/album/4iWVwPV3bkt3ZKV840IDSL?si=xGL4kjZxQlaUmTPCJOFQHA</p></div>
