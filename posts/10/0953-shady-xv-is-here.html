  <h1>Shady XV Is Here</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Let's be honest, Eminem is one of the best rap artists out there – he can rap circles around you.</p><p>If he's not on your list of best artists you're just being a hater; although he can come off kind of <em>hocky</em> at times, he pretty much earns a pass.</p><p>His latest release <em>Shady XV</em> is a compilation that showcases his re-energized Shady Records.</p><p>It's a good look for hip-hop, and we'll explain why in a minute.</p><p>Let's talk about the tracks.

The album starts off with a barrage of bars from Slim himself on the self-produced title track, which sets the tone.</p><p>Stand-outs from there include <em>Vegas</em> (by Bad Meets Evil), which features the overhyped Iggy Azalea rape jokes (ha?), Slaughterhouse's <em>Y'all Know Me</em> produced by Primo and the Just Blaze/Boy 1da produced <em>Psychopathic Killer</em>.</p><p>Em's self-produced <em>Right For Me</em> and <em>Fine Line</em> are also good listens.</p><p>In all the project features Kobe, Slaughterhouse, Yelawolf, Skylar Gray and anyone from the D that matters.</p><p>Now why is this album a good look for hip-hop?</p><p>It's cover to cover bars.</p><p>It seems like good old fashioned skills are slowly taking the main stage again in hip-hop – and like any "corporation" it needs to start from the top down.</p><p>Instead of signing gimmicky "hype" artists, Em seems to be rolling with spitters (like them or not).</p><p>D12 kind of gets a pass, but everyone else here has bars.</p><p>The album closes with the Static Selektah produced Detroit vs Everyone, which (again) we predict will be a thing once other cities drop replies.</p><p>Disc 2 is all old joints, we skipped that.</p><p>It's now out everywhere – <a href="http://www.melodyspot.com/albums/view/422/Eminem-_Shady-XV">stream it here</a>.
