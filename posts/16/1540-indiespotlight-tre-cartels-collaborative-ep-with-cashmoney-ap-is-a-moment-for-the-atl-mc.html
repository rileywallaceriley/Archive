  <h1>#IndieSpotlight: Tre Cartel's Collaborative EP With CashMoney AP Is A Moment For The ATL MC</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>ATL MC Tre Cartel is someone who we've championed quite a bit in the past, which it's exciting to finally get his three-song EP<em> Obtain This Grain</em> -- as it feels like a moment for him.</p><p>Produced entirely by CashMoney AP -- a platinum-selling beatsmith whose crafted hits for the likes of Lil Wayne, YoungBoy Never Broke Again, Ski Mask The Slump God, Tory Lanez, Dave East, Jay Critch, and MANY more -- the offering is concise but poignant.

It kicks off with "That Guy," which is a dollar-sign tinged profession of why he's that catch that "she" has been looking for -- featuring a guest verse from YFA King, who smashes the melodic flow. "Knock Your Hustle" is another song aimed at a female, quite cohesively playing off the thematic elements of the first track.</p><p>The special sauce though is the absolute banger "Formula," in which he notes "I think I found out the formula," adding that he's just warming up.</p><p>His evolved Migo-esque flow with his cadence and the gorgeous flute in the bridge of the record make this song almost ironic in it's prophetic in its overall message.</p><p>At three songs, it's an appetizer at best; yet Tre Cartel appears to have hit his stride over this batch of insanely fire beats supplied by CashMoney.</p><p>While we may see him open up a little more below the surface when we're blessed with a larger body of work to digest, <em>Obtain This Grain</em> has a hearty helping of replay value worth adding to your playlist if you're in search of the next-big-thing to pop from the hotbed that is Atlanta.
