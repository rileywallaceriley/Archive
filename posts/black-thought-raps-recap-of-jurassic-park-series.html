    <div class="meta">2018-06-12 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the fifth installment of the Jurassic Park film series, is scheduled to hit theaters on June 22. To help get fans back up to speed, Black Thought provided a succinct recap of the series on Monday night (June 11) during The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon."Let’s start with the first film, I’ll tell you what I know/ Hammond is the man demanding bringing back dinos," he raps, flashing back to the 1993 original blockbuster film. "There are raptors in the kitchen, but I don’t wanna spoil it/ Just know the lawyer gets eaten on the toilet."He then hops through the other four films, even referencing Fallon's cameo in the Jurassic World film."The boys jump in a gyrosphere, and their chances are flimsy/ Even though they watched the safety video with Jimmy."Fans of the show know that Black Thought often provides lyrical recaps, such as his end-of-season Game Of Thrones raps or his Olympics wrap-up.</p>
<p>But when he's not busy with The Tonight Show, he's creating acclaimed projects such as the Streams Of Thought Vol. 1 EP with 9th Wonder.Check out Black Thought's recap below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jrRaPbGWT4</p></div>
