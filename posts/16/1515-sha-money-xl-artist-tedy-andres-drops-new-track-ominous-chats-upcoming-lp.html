  <div class="content"><p>It’s been a process for young Houston-bred MC Tedy Andres; he’s been bubbling up over the past few years, setting the stage for his upcoming release, which is poised to change everything. “I've been rapping since I was like 13,” he tells AAHH, “that was ten years ago, man., man.

“It's been a slow build,” he continues. “I released a project called <i>Mad Illusions</i> and started getting a little buzz off the song called ’Mercedes.’” He rode that buzz and aside from multiple online nods, captured the attention of industry heavyweight Sha Money XL.

Sha was a producer for 50 Cent at his (musical) peak, and served as president of G-Unit Records, before taking the helm as VP of A&amp;R at Def Jam in 2010.</p><p>Currently working as an executive at Epic Records, he is currently managing Tedy.

“That's like a big brother to me,” Tedy says of working with the storied executive. “We got a great relationship, he's a top 5 A&amp;R in the game, you know what I mean?</p><p>So sending him records and getting his opinion is always good.

“He's was a businessman,” he adds. “We've been working hard together,” he notes.</p><p>His latest release, “Ominous,” is a song that is setting the stage for his upcoming project. “My producer  and I locked in the studio and ade that beat together,”’he explains. “I just had some inspiration a couple of days after ... it’s a storytelling vibe about a couple of people I know.”

He cautions not to get too comfortable with the vibe of “Ominous,” as he’s definitely diversifying his vibe. “I don't really have a title for it yet ...</p><p>I'm kinda keeping it under wraps,” he says of the LP. “I’ve been making a bunch of records, and hopefully around October I can get this  out.

“There's going to be different types of things,” he explains. “I mean, it's going to be lifestyle, it’s going to be storytelling ...</p><p>I'm trying to make new, different types of records.</p><p>I've just been making a bunch of songs and they all sound a little different, but I'm going to wait til everything sonically go together.”

One producer he’s worked with is Harlem’s own V-Don — who we’ve chatted with in the past.</p><p>His sound is quite dark, but Tedy is clear that he is trying to brighten things up this time around.

“I don't want to do something so dark because my last project was a little dark ...</p><p>I was kind of in a dark place for it,” he says. “I don't even want to put it in a box right now because I've been making so many records.“

Tedy has lots lined up, including a host of new videos that will line up with the release of the new project.</p><p>Ultimately, he just wants this album to be an enduring, timeless piece of art.

“I just want to be the best,” he exclaims without hesitation. “I want people to love it.</p><p>I want it to be a classic, you know what I mean?”
