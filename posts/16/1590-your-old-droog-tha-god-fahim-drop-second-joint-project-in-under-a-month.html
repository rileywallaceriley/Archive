  <h1>Your Old Droog & Tha God Fahim Drop Second Joint Project In Under A Month</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sun, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your Old Droog is on an absolutely insane run right now, with back-to-back gems such as <em>Dump YOD: Krutoy Edition, Jewelry, It Wasn't Even Close</em> — and Tha God Fahim literally never stops dropping.</p><p>In fact, to put it lightly, his catalog is massive .</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With so much creative energy between these two, you know when they collide you get quality, and last month’s collaboration EP <em>Tha Wolf On Wall St </em>(which included a few Mach-Hommy features) was no exception.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not quite letting the momentum stop, they’ve now released a follow-up, Tha YOD Fahim.</p><p>Sitting at 14 tracks, the project includes the Pharoahe Monch featured “Slam Dunk Contest” — as well as production by Nottz, Quelle Chris, Fahim himself and more.</p>
