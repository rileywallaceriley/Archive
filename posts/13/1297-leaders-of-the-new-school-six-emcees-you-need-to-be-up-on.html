  <h1>Leaders Of The New School: Six Emcees You Need To Be Up On</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>2016 has been a pretty good year for music; particularly, for unsigned acts.</p><p>We received an overwhelming amount of submissions here, and there was a handful that resonated incredibly well with me—for a multitude of reasons.</p><p>I've taken the liberty of breaking them down below.</p><p>If you're not up on them yet—now's a good time to add them to your playlists.</p><p>Don't sleep!

<b>Aaron Cohen</b>

https://youtu.be/svMHck2MzHg

He has been bubbling in circles for a minute, but the Seattle-native popped onto my radar with his 2015 release <i>Homeless</i>.</p><p>His latest release, <i>Off The Ground</i> has been his biggest to date, premiering on XXL and spawning overseas tour dates.</p><p>After hearing what he has in the stash via a Facebook Live session, and with a Paris festival already booked for 2017, the New Year is about to be kind to him!

<b>Intelligenz</b>

https://youtu.be/Dv1kd89A7Jk

Smart, pretty, articulate, and blessed with the soul of a real emcee, Intelligenz has had a great year.</p><p>I had a great interview—which was more of a casual hip-hop convo—earlier this summer.</p><p>She rounded off a year of buzz-worthy stage shows with a European tour supporting Slick Rick The Ruler, even premiering her latest single in France, where she opened for Red, Meth, and De La Soul.</p><p>Oh, and she's signed to HipNott ; no big deal.

<b>Matt Citron</b>

https://youtu.be/zhwpWwsnDJA

I get an intimidating amount of artist submissions, but something about Matt Citron resonated with me.</p><p>Maybe it was the legendary DJ Greg Street calling him the next hottest thing out of Atlanta.</p><p>Maybe it was the overall dopeness of his single "404" that features Cyhi The Prince.</p><p>Perhaps it's his undeniable industry buzz and his as if yet unreleased work with D.I.T.C's Buckwild; whatever it is, this kid is going to pop, and the excitement radiating from his circle is infectious.

<b>NXUS</b>

https://youtu.be/T3Ge31MO3EA

22-year-old NXUS, who is one-third of the trio known as Dead Reputation (with Delirious Beats  and Rake ), continues to impress me.</p><p>I was a huge fan of their last collective release, “Rake Cat,” and his latest record “Holy wATEr” is just crack.</p><p>I get the vibe from NXUS; he has something about him–you can just feel that he’s headed along the right incline.</p><p>A hidden gem, for sure.

<b>Track Seven Band</b>

https://youtu.be/GgxpfGwpC5U

Back in 2011, Bronx rapper, Cost, was looking for a band to back him for live performances.</p><p>What he found is what we now, five years later, know as the Track Seven Band.</p><p>Their EP, <i>The Try And The Fail</i>, was one of the better projects I reviewed this year.</p><p>It's as hip-hop as you can get, and at points deeply personal, but packaged with an unmistakable crossover appeal.</p><p>You could easily listen to this whole project without listening to the depth of the content, and just enjoy it for what it is.</p><p>The mark of excellence.

<b>Sir B</b>

https://youtu.be/jdem13sUX3I

Sir B is an artist who started getting some industry buzz back in 2013, both for playing Quentin Miller for a multitude of ATL rappers and dropping his debut mixtape, SIR’tified.</p><p>His mixtape, <i>Letters From Rehab</i>, was a fantastic find that I feared might slide under the radar.</p><p>Sir B himself is incredibly charismatic — he has that inexplicable “thing” that most big artists tend to have in common.</p><p>An artist that deserves a solid spot on your 2017 watch list!
