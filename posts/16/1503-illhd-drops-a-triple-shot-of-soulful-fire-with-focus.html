  <h1>IllHD Drops A Triple Shot Of Soulful Fire With “Focus”</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sun, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Rapper and filmmaker IllHD has a unique view of the world.</p><p>Currently based in the cultural hub that is Atlanta, the creative force never genuinely working on new material; "I’m a filmmaker that raps about what I film, even if I'm filming another artist it’s like I am filming the soundtrack to what I see ... then I rap about it,” he says.</p><p>His latest — <i>Focus</i> — is a three-song shot of dopeness.</p><p>His bars are super poignant, relevant, and packed with reality.</p><p>The title track, with its deep undertones, horns and spacey sounds, “Danger” with its Dipset-era-esque sample, and the low-key vibe of “Make It Out,” are great intros to Ill, if it’s your first impression.</p><p>Stream it now, via Spotify.
