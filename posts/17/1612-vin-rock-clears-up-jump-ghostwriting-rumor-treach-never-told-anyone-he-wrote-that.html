  <h1>Vin Rock Clears Up “Jump” Ghostwriting Rumor: "Treach Never Told Anyone He Wrote That!"</h1>

<p>A recently <a href="https://youtu.be/JF2eC0RW2aY?si=4GIRRHydD9PW-V9j">resurfaced interview</a> with Everlast, frontman of House of Pain, has reignited discussions about the origins of Kris Kross's hit song "Jump." The interview, which is actually about four years old, caught the attention of producer Jermaine Dupri, who <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-ziKhrRhld/?igsh=amJqeWZtZ3NuM3F3">took to Instagram</a> to address the claims.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dupri, who produced "Jump" for Kris Kross, vehemently denied allegations that the song was copied from House of Pain's "Jump Around." In his Instagram post, Dupri stated, "I wrote the song," and pointed out the timeline discrepancy, noting that Kris Kross's "Jump" was released on February 9, while "Jump Around" came out three months later on May 5.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dupri's response also alluded to another unfounded claim - that Treach of Naughty By Nature had ghostwritten "Jump." This mention prompted a swift and detailed response from Vin Rock, Treach's groupmate in Naughty By Nature.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vin Rock took to the comments section of Dupri's post to clear the air, stating unequivocally, "Treach never, ever told anyone he wrote that!" He then provided context for the long-standing rumors and misunderstandings between Naughty By Nature and Dupri.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his comments, Vin Rock explained the interconnected history of the "jump" theme in hip-hop:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"ALL CREATIVES get inspired JD.</p><p>We know Naughty did the Jump shit in OPP video AND our live stage show at the time was BONKERS!!!</p><p>We had the Jackson 5 sample so Naughty DEFINITELY pairs up with the narrative assuming Treach wrote Jump."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vin Rock also addressed the root of the conflict, which stemmed from a magazine article where Dupri had commented on Vin Rock's songwriting:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The ONLY reason why Treach mentioned you in our Craziest song is because of the magazine article YSB when you said people criticized Kriss Kross because they didn't write their rhymes.</p><p>You said we'll VINNIE doesn't write his rhymes which initially was true HOWEVER I was already writing AND it inspired my verse on Craziest."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite the past tensions, Vin Rock's tone was conciliatory, highlighting the impact of all three "jump"-themed songs:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"OPP, Jump Around and Jump are 3 of the most ICONIC songs not only from that Era but IN HIP HOP PERIOD!!!</p><p>LET'S CELEBRATE CREATIVITY, INSPIRATION AND LEGACY!!!"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This exchange serves as a reminder of how misunderstandings and rumors can persist in the industry—sometimes for decades.</p>
