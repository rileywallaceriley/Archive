  <h1>Crowd Sourcing Platforms = Independent Music 2.0</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><blockquote>
<p class="p1">Now we are here to collaborate with <b>YOU</b>, humanoid, on the most exciting project we’ve ever done.</p>
<p class="p1">– De La Soul</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Yesterday I received an email from De La Soul  informing me that they would be releasing their <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1519102394/de-la-souls-new-album">first album in a decade</a>.</p><p>It's currently available for preorder on Kickstarter in digital, and physical format.</p><p>Tiered levels of support come with perks, such as De La Soul USB keys, shoes and limited edition shirts.</p><p>Needless to say, I'm excited to get my copy of the album in the mail, and review here for all of you.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It seems like many artists are finding themselves on platforms like Kickstarter (and indigogo) these days.</p><p>Some notable projects have included <a title="Big Pun – Bronx Legends Never Die" href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/big-pun-bronx-legends-never-die/">Domingo's Big Pun EP</a>, and <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/raskass/ras-kass-untitled-project-2010-limited-cd-and-vin-0">Ras Kass's A.D.I.D.A.S project</a>.</p><p>Let's face it, independent music sales isn't easy, and the production of an album is (generally) far from free.</p><p>Kickstarter campaigns really make an artist vulnerable, but can also help them gauge the loyalty of their fanbase, and actual demand for their music.</p><p>Allowing fans to be a part of your process and know that their money is positively benefitting the actual production of your music is a valuable connection to make. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It's this type of platform that has record labels scrambling.</p><p>Kickstarter (and others) has unwittingly created a platform for musicians to sell music and keep 100% of the take, minus any personal overhead and nominal handling fee of course.</p><p>My thought is that we may see that change in the future.</p><p>Perhaps a Kickstarter for musicians, that finds a way to generate more revenue for the company.</p><p>But for the time being, it's an amazing outlet for acts like De La Soul, and up and coming acts such as <a href="https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kickstarter.com%2Fprojects%2F232550405%2Flil-dickys-kickstarter-album-videos-touring&amp;ei=KPgbVYT2O8OfyAS20YG4DA&amp;usg=AFQjCNFSyuMq56RC3Mgnj4H8J1XiBdHpgA&amp;sig2=3MQbY8ZahltLz1dLyZrw1g">Lil'Dicky</a> to positively exploit growing fan bases, and loyal followers in a way that simply posting music for sale on services like Bandcamp can't replicate.. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Maybe instead of artist trying to change the face of music history with streaming music services, they should more intimately and authentically connect with their fans and produce a crowd sourced project.</p><p>Just saying.</p><p>This is the wave!</span></p>
