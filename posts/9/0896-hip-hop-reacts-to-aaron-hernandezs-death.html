  <h1>Hip Hop Reacts To Aaron Hernandez's Death</h1>
  <div class="meta">2017-04-19 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>This morning, amid initial shock, feelings were mixed toward the death of former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez, who was serving life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p><p>Initially sentenced in 2015, he was also facing two additional life sentences for a 2012 drive-by shooting, in which he was implicated as the shooter.</p><p>Just five days ago he was acquitted of both murders, inspiring some hope in his legal team that perhaps, pending an appeal, he could one day be a free man again.That hope was dashed as he was found dead in his cell this morning of an apparent suicide.</p><p>News spread quickly, and many in the Hip Hop community shared their reactions on Twitter.A growing number of users seemed to reject the "theory" of suicide — notably his former agent.</p><p>Some suggested that it wouldn't make sense following his recent legal victories.</p><p>Although, as many memes point out, this ignores the fact that Aaron was still set to spend the rest of his life behind bars.</p><p>Some chose to point out that perhaps, in light of the brazen nature of his initial conviction, his death should be talked about in a different way. https://twitter.com/KatiePavlich/status/854657254397751298 https://twitter.com/Fabio227/status/854659836251910144 At the end of the day, though, the tragedy of the situation is that multiple loved ones were taken from their families, and that includes Hernandez's.</p><p>Although an archaic legal principle called “abatement ab initio” will see his conviction voided, ensuring he dies as an innocent man, there is definitely no closure, or easy answer as to why he chose to throw it all away.</p></div>
