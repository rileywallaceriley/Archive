Salute to one of the greatest!</p><p>February 6th marks Dilla Day, an annual celebration of the legacy that the late-great producer James Dewitt Yancey, better known professionally as J.Dilla, has left behind.</p><p>Gatherings in various cities celebrate the music (and spirit) of the Detroit native with concerts, lectures and more.</p><p>Dilla, who Questlove described in the film <em>My Vinyl Weighs A Ton</em> as their our Dali Lama, was a nucleus in hip-hop culture – and influenced countless producers and artists who had the please to either work with or simply listen to his music.</p><p>As tribute to him, and to celebrate Dilla Day, we thought it would be fitting to drop a Dilla video-mix.</p><p>RIP!

<em>If you were to secretly ask the most praised hip-hop producers, if given a top three, who they fear the most, Dilla’s name would chart on everyone’s list, hands down.</em>

<strong>–Questlove, drummer from The Roots</strong>

<em>All the greats respected him the most. ...</p><p>Common actually stayed with him in his last days -- they both stayed in L.A. together -- and we would go over there when we were working on the album.</p><p>And I remember him giving me drums.</p><p>It was such an honor for him to actually give me drums because I'd actually stolen so many drums off of his beat CDs. (laughs) ...</p><p>Let's also talk about how many rappers bit his style.</p><p>He even inspired a lot of rappers.</p><p>The way he would space his words on the beat.</p><p>The patterns he would get...</p><p>All that.</p><p>Whenever people do that, that's Jay Dee all day long. </em>

<strong>–Kanye West, Rapper and Producer, from an interview with Semtex on BBC Radio, February 18th, 2006</strong>

<em>I can't begin to explain the influence his mind and ear has had on my band, myself, and the careers of so many other artists.</p><p>The most humble, modest, worthy and gifted beatmaker I've known...and definitely the best producer on a mic. </em>
