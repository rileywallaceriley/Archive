  <div class="content"><p>Karrueche Tran sat down with Ebro and Laura Styles on Hot 97's Ebro In the Morning Thursday (September 21).</p><p>During the nearly 30-minute interview, she discussed her restraining order against ex-boyfriend Chris Brown, current role on TNT's series Claws, upcoming movie roles and oddly enough, the smell of her farts.The conversation began with a discussion about her acting role as Virginia, a former prostitute, in Claws, which Ebro quickly noted he didn't watch."Why wouldn't you watch Claws?" Karrueche asked in response.</p><p>Laura went on to explain the show is more than just nails — it touches on everything from drug smuggling and murder to sex."I have sex in the first episode," Karrueche says.Things shifted gears to her relationship with R&B singer Brown. "I'm proud of how you guys handled that publicly," Ebro said, noting his own relationship with Brown."I'm focused on my work more than ever," she says. "I also have an RO  in place.</p><p>But it's all good vibes."As she frames it, the injunction has allowed them both to live their separate lives without any drama.https://youtu.be/C34ccZAubc8?t=3m29sAccording to TMZ, Karrueche took the stand in her restraining order case stating that post-break-up, Brown demanded diamond rings he bought for her to be returned.</p><p>After she refused, she says he became aggressive.</p><p>She also told the judge the singer had physically abused her in the past."It got to a point where I was like ...</p><p>I can't," she said.Later in the interview, Karrueche, who is currently single, spoke about relationships, and was drawn into a conversation with Ebro about boundaries when it comes to bathroom habits.</p><p>Then he dropped the bomb, "You're a hot girl.</p><p>Let's talk about what your farts smell like," to which she retorted, "You want to smell it?"Despite Ebro's, "You got one ready?" response, no farts were dealt on air (we think).Watch the full interview above.</p></div>
