— M.T.G</blockquote>
Chi-town rapper and Moving Towards Greatness is aiming high with his new single, "Kendall." The track has a dump that zero for a hero undertone, albeit more mature – and explicit.</p><p>Kendall, for those unaware, she is one of the two younger Kardashian twins.</p><p>Not the one who dyed her hair pink and posed with on-and-off boyfriend Tyga on Valentines Day, the other one.</p><p>As M.T.G explains: "Today everybody is caught up in trying not to get played by someone.</p><p>With this record, I wanted to bring back that feeling of being sprung for somebody and not caring what people think.</p><p>It can be a generalization.</p><p>I chose a (love) target, Kendall.</p><p>I always wanted a Kardashian."

B.I.G said it best: "Think big you get big." Check out the joint below.
