"Y'all know that's the real reason we came."Dizz and Fatboy SSE are no strangers to The Breakfast Club.</p><p>Dizz, the CEO of York Records is an associate of DJ Envy -- and friend of the cast.</p><p>His artist, Cory North, released his debut music video, appropriately titled "Poppin' Off," which featured a fictitious scenario on The Breakfast Club where Cory misses his interview, causing Charlamagne to give him an auto Donkey Of The Day title.</p><p>SSE has become a huge online property, with over 2.6 million followers on Instagram alone with the help of his hilarious videos.</p><p>His latest song, "Drake" with Lar$$en, is on its way to a million spins on SoundCloud.</p><p>He also recently popped up in the new Juicy J video.Fatboy's run up on the highly rated morning show was (definitely) not to be taken seriously, but rather as another funny addition to the comedian's catalog.</p></div>
