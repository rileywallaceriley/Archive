  <h1>Teen Arrested For Wanting Lil Uzi Vert's New Album So Bad He Threatened To Shoot Up School</h1>
  <div class="meta">2017-05-16 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>A high school student in Pasco County, Florida issued a school shooting threat via Facebook last Thursday (May 11), according to Tampa Bay's WFTS.</p><p>The reason for the potential shooting?</p><p>The 16-year-old Lil Uzi Vert fan was frustrated about the delay of the anxiously awaited Luv is Rage 2 LP.Deputies spoke to the teen and his mother, and found two firearms in a lockbox at the home.</p><p>The lockbox key was missing, so the owners forced it open to show deputies the firearms were (thankfully) still in it.</p><p>The unidentified minor was promptly arrested for false reports of a hoax and threats to do violence with a firearm to a school.Just over a month ago, Uzi's producer and label manager DJ Don Cannon revealed that the actual project wasn't complete during a fan Q&A. "Luv Is Rage 2 is not dropping no time soon," Cannon said. "It's not going to be a long time from now but not within this month.</p><p>We still working on the album." threat itself — "drop luv is rage 2 before i shoot up my school" — could be seen as dark humor, but there is a grim history to suggest that threats have the potential to turn into tragedy — fast."We can be right 99 percent of the time .. but that one percent where we don't have a sense of urgency, that's the bad day," said a spokesperson for the Pasco County Sheriff's Office.On Episode 111 of The Joe Budden Podcast, Budden revealed veteran Atlantic executive Michael Kyser noted Uzi's insane streaming numbers are the true reason behind the lack of urgency about a new project. "He's doing 50 million streams a week," Kyser said. "Why do I need to put an album out?""XO TOUR Llif3," along with a now legendary crowd jump during Miami's Rolling Loud music festival, has earned him a heap of new fans and increased the appetite of his day-one fans for more material.</p><p>Fortunately, the Pasco County community didn't find out how far this particular fan was willing to go.</p><p>This threat is one of three that were investigated last week in Pasco County.So far, Uzi hasn't commented publicly on the incident.</p></div>
