  <h1>Meek Mill Teams With JAY-Z's Roc Nation For Docuseries About Criminal Justice System</h1>
  <div class="meta">2018-05-03 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Just over a week after Meek Mill‘s release from prison, the Dreamchasers MC is getting to work on a new documentary series — produced by The Intellectual Property Corporation in partnership with Roc Nation — that will explore his journey towards exoneration and examine the many flaws that currently exist within the criminal justice system.As first reported by Deadline, the series will primarily follow Meek and his team as they discover and explore the corruption that has kept him treading deep waters in Philadelphia’s legal system for the better part of his adult life.</p><p>The series will also provide exclusive access to his post-incarceration happenings.JAY-Z, a very public supporter of Meek and one of the executive producers of the series, shared his thought on Meek’s release in a statement sent to DX last week.“He was incarcerated unjustly and caught in a probation trap for years by a broken system,” Hov said. “We thank every individual that has supported and fought alongside Meek every step of the way.”The currently untitled series is slated to air exclusively on Amazon Prime Video.</p></div>
