  <h1>DJ Khaled's Trying To Sign Lil Pump</h1>
  <div class="meta">2018-01-25 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Gucci Mane recently made it known that he was interested in signing Lil Pump.</p><p>Now it appears that DJ Khaled is also interested in the "Gucci Gang" artist — and a deal may already be on the table.“I told my lawyer this is urgent ... let’s get this deal done,” Khaled wrote in the caption of an Instagram post — allegedly while still in the meeting. “Let the lawyers work."Khaled’s move to potentially bring the rising star to We The Best Music Group is more overt than Gucci’s understated (yet powerful) request for Pump to simply “name the price.”Earlier this month, it was revealed that Pump’s five-album contract with Warner Bros. had been voided because he was underage when it was signed.</p><p>This allowed him to become a free agent and field new offers.Check out more pictures from Khaled's meeting with Pump below.</p></div>
