Hip-hop, in it's current iteration, comes -- and goes -- in waves.</p><p>The waves all have catalysts (like Drake, Kid Cudi, or younger drill gods like Keef, Santana, and Dirk), and set the stage for a tsunami of similarity.</p><p>Rappers, influenced by other rappers, borrow flows which influence other rappers; you see where I'm going.</p><p>The cycle continues until one brave soul goes against the grain and challenges the norm, setting off another chain reaction.</p><p>It's hard to imagine fully an artist without a direct influence or at least a point of reference.</p><p>Well, perhaps you haven't heard of Coke La Rock, widely accepted to be the first rapper ever to touch a mic.</p><p>History shows that at the <a href="https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=11&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0xtqHjOvLAhUKs4MKHbRnDZoQFghHMAo&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.history.com%2Fthis-day-in-history%2Fhip-hop-is-born-at-a-birthday-party-in-the-bronx&amp;usg=AFQjCNEVpQFve97pu83LUtdheD5Il3FywQ&amp;sig2=onse4sIKIrO6MlAqG5jWKg">infamous 1973 party that DJ Kool Herc threw for his sister Cindy</a>, hip-hop was born, in every way possible.</p><p>Herc changed the game, of course, but -- most important to this conversation -- a young (street) rapper who was then known as A1 Coke, or Coco, grabbed the mic and changed the world.</p><p>Amidst playfully calling out his homies, using an echo chamber, he dropped the following:

<em>"There is not a man that can’t be thrown
A horse that can’t be rode
A bull that can’t be stopped
There is not a disco that I Coke La Rock can’t rock."</em>

Just like that, the first rap infected the crowd and quickly spread and took on a life of its own.</p><p>Coke, shortly after Kool Herc was stabbed a party some years later, walked away from rap.</p><p>A move, he said at the time, was partly to let some of the younger cats have a chance at wearing the crown.</p><p>Unfortunately, Coke came up in an era that pre-dates a constant documenting of experiences.</p><p>Thus, we're left only with stories and beautifully preserved digital copies of 1970's and 80's party fliers.</p><p>Is there a point or lesson to this?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Coke La Rock often describes what he did that night as just having fun with his friends.</p><p>He had no preconceived notions of fame, no desire to sign a deal -- he didn't even have rhymes written.</p><p>He didn't record any records!</p><p>It was improvisational, organic, and inspiring.</p><p>It was, quite literally, the purest example of hip-hop ever.</p><p>The lesson is that artists need to take some time to listen to their inner voice, and find a way to materialize that into their music.</p><p>Music doesn't have to be a jumble of influences outside of your experience.</p><p>As well, genuine admiration for an artist doesn't have to lead directly to similar music.</p><p>Stop trying so hard to fit in, and work harder at standing out.</p><p>Listen to your heart -- it will tell you if you're truly in this game for the right reason.</p><p>If Coke La Rock can do it, you can to!</p><p>Stop biting!</p><p>To learn more about Coke La Rock’s Story, check out this great video by Steve Hager.</p><p>Steve Documented hip hop's birth and founded the Cannabis Cup -- amongst other things.</p></div>
