    <div class="meta">2018-06-04 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Grammy award-winning songwriter/producer James Fauntleroy -- a member of No I.D.'s Cocaine 80s collective and a prominent collaborator of Bruno Mars -- caused a stir on Sunday (June 3) by sharing some candid opinions on Pusha T and Kanye West via Twitter."Pusha T was a drug dealer; now he's a snitch," he tweeted. "It's crazy how you can grow up to be the total opposite of everything you thought you would/wanted to be."Fauntleroy has a history with G.O.O.D. Music, appearing on numerous tracks on Cruel Summer, including "Clique." He has also worked with Drake, notably on the song "Girls Love Beyonce."https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkHkaY0HpZYhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDDk5Th30J4Later in the rant, Fauntleroy remarked -- among other points -- that G.O.O.D.</p>
<p>Music does terrible business. He also said West has the most "behind the scenes helping hands" in the industry."40 is an amazing human being," he said, referring to Drake's longtime friend/collaborator Noah "40" Shebib, who was name-dropped in "The Story Of Adidon" diss. "The niggas y'all defending do bad business, treat people like shit in real life and not even rapping well.</p>
<p>Since y'all love snitching so much."He added, "Kanye (literally) has had the most ghost creators in music history. Kanye got ghostwriters, ghost stylists, ghost producers, ghosts everything!</p>
<p>No wonder these niggas see ghosts! They got em EVERYWHERE."Some of the people bothered by Fauntleroy's outburst seemed to suggest he was going the extra mile to defend Drake.</p>
<p>He was quick to refute the claims, noting he was only bothered by wack raps and the line about 40.Fauntleroy insinuated he might leave Twitter, but he made sure to go out on a high note if so."Before I go again, while y’all favs were setting black culture back a thousand years to get out of debt, I bought a 20k Sq ft building in Inglewood CA," he wrote. "Built an academy teaching music, coding, marketing, & success w/o being a bitch ass nigga - sign up for your workshops ASAP!"Check out the full rant below.</p></div>
