  <h1>SlurRty – Time</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Full disclosure, I'm over three decades old.</p><p>I'm a father of two young children, and I've been immersed and plugged into hip-hop culture since the early 90s.</p><p>So, like most older heads, sometimes the newer generations  of artists make me feel old.</p><p>One such movement was led by the based god, Lil' B. I didn't get it.</p><p>I gave it repeated attempts, but couldn't grasp the appeal; however his sheer cult status intrigued me, and I eventually wrapped my mind around the direction that he and the artists affiliated with him were going.</p><p>One young producer, along the same vein, is SlurRty.</p><p>I've had his name pop up a few times in conversations, which prompted me to delve in.</p><p>Why is he notable?</p><p>Well, off the top, he's produced for the based god, as well as Tyga's artist, Honey Cocaine, Love and Hip Hop Hollywood star Soulja Boy, and much more.</p><p>So, as far as production is concerned, he has a pretty solid resume.</p><p>As an artist, he comes off a little more polished than some of the artists's he's produced for -- personally.</p><p>His music is often slow, hypnotic, and full of distorted, varied style.</p><p>But he also shakes shit up.</p><p>For example, you think you have him pinned when listening to his last record "Baddest Bitch I Ever Seen," but the he drops jazzy boom-bap hip-hop on "After Party." He's quite eclectic.</p><p>Kind of like a new-age Kool Keith.</p><p>He doesn't seem to prescribe to a standard and does so consistently.</p><p>Not unlike Lil'B; when I previously said that I suddenly understood the movement, it was Lil'B's consistency.</p><p>SluRty's music takes some risks -- that's his constant.</p><p>He has a youthful vibe.</p><p>Take a listen to his latest joint, "Time," fresh out of the studio.</p><p>You'll also want to go through his production catalog.
