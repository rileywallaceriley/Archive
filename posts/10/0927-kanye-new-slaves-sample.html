  <h1>Kanye New Slaves Sample</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Kanye is, and always has been a perfectionist.</p><p>Artists have often remarked that after recording a song with him, they are taken aback by the evolution the song takes behind the scenes as Kanye <em>works his magic</em>.</p><p>This was the case for Benjamin Bronfman (part of the <a href="http://teachersband.com/">Teachers</a> collective), a producer friend of Kanye West, who was contacted by Yeezus and urged to send him some beats for an upcoming project – which culminated as the critically acclaimed <em><a href=" Benjamin cooked up a handful of tracks but one of his demos, <a href="http://teachers.fm/"><em>Cruel Cold Winter</em></a>, obviously rubbed Yeezy the right way.</p><p>It wasn't until Benjamin attended a listening party that he realized that his track had been used – and how Kanye had evolved (or rather devolved) the sound.</p><p>Check it out for yourself after the jump.

The track, which became <em><a href=" Slaves</a></em>, was for lack of a better description, the "single" off the album.</p><p>It was part of Kanye's <a href=" and international release strategy</a> – and according to Yeezy himself the tracks second verse was "the best rap verse of all time".</p><p>Personally, I think this demo version is crazy dope, what do you think?
