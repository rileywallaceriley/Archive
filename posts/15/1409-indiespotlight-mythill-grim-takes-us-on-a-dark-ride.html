  <h1>#IndieSpotlight: Mythill Grim Takes Us On A Dark Ride</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>When you hear the term most exciting artist on the Irish Hip Hop scene, you may be apt to expect someone more — well — Irish.</p><p>Ignorance of Ireland's dynamic aside, we've long been fed small glimpses into the scene.</p><p>For example, I've been up on Rob Kelly for a while now; however, he noticeably sounded Irish.</p><p>Mythill Grim is a different experience.</p><p>The Nigerian-born MC had a few keywords attached to him, so my introduction required a unique strategy.</p><p>I was prepped that he was a little on the darker side, so I opted to only listen to his three latest singles without the visual for the first few passes.</p><p>First impression was great.</p><p>He has such a unique cadence that it's almost hard to pinpoint his geographical origin.</p><p>When listened to in order, his first three singles "Crestfallen," "Leave Me Alone," and the newest, "Comfortable," do have a darker feeling to them.</p><p>In succession, they almost play out as a downward spiral of sorts.</p><p>Beginning with "Crestfallen," we hear the young MC describing an emotional rock bottom; the song can either be taken at face value as an overall dependent love or as  a depressing description of falling deep in love — or want — for someone. "Leave Me Alone" feels like an ode to social detachment, and whether you choose to assume he's talking to you (the listener) or the same someone from "Crestfallen," is subjective. "Comfortable," again assuming there is some direct connection, is the dissolution of the relationship — as the result of potential infidelity.</p><p>How, once you watch the actual visuals, the songs — which have incredible production, BTW — have become much darker. "Crestfallen" looks how it sounds, but the color and face paint on "Leave Me Alone" has an unnerving aura.</p><p>When discussing "Leave Me Alone" with District Magazine's Eric Donaldson, he explained, “It was just supposed to be a fun freestyle, but my heart got in the way.” The songs Nigerian intro also has a fun bit of "hidden message" appeal to it.</p><p>It all comes to a disturbing conclusion in "Comfortable," where we're led to conclude he's killed his unfaithful girlfriend, and maybe even himself.</p><p>Even that strange character who seems to be following him through his last two visuals is creepy AF.</p><p>Could be it symbolize the darkness inside of him?</p><p>The music itself is really interesting and draws you in.</p><p>Not quite trap-soul vibes, it's a night drive that sounds as though it hasn't seen the sunshine in ages!</p><p>It's a really dope -- and evident why this kid seems to be connecting with audiences.</p><p>Give it a spin.</p></div>
