    <div class="content"><p>As Nine prepares to reintroduce himself to the game with his new album King -- dropping on September 9 -- he's gifting fans with the LP's third single "Belafonte" featuring Conway The Machine.DJ Illegal, 1/5 of The Snowgoons (who produced the entirety of the new album) explained to HipHopDX how the collaboration with the Shady Records MC came about."The track came together when I asked Nine who are his favorite new artists," he says. "Right away he mentioned Conway, Westside Gunn, Benny The Butcher -- all of the Griselda Crew."Just some days later the homie Sean Strange, who is connected with the whole Griselda team, made it happen."Earlier this month, Nine spoke to HipHopDX about his legacy and the new album.“I am not happy with where I am placed on the list in Hip Hop,” he says, explaining what his motivation is after 20 years. King is set to be Nine's way of establishing his stamp on the culture. “Snowgoon’s production got something out of me that I did not know was still there."The album is available for pre-order, here.</p>
