    <div class="meta">2020-02-17 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Less than 24 hours after the birthday of Conway The Machine, producer and videographer Myster DL unleashes “Tragedy,” a collaboration between the Griselda spitter and Nebraska MC Fieldhouse.In conversation with HipHopDX, DL broke down the collaboration, explaining that it not only marked his true return to music, but a tip of the iceberg he has in the stash for this year.“I met Fieldhouse a few years back,” he explains. “He flew out from Nebraska to shoot a video with me for a song he had with Slaine ... I didn't know what to expect as a lot of the Midwest rap I was hearing was not for me. I was quite impressed with his music.”https://youtu.be/IRLc6eLgqi0DL has spent the last while creating a hefty résumé of video work, with a client list that includes (among many others) Cypress Hill, Ruste Juxx and -- of course -- Conway.</p>
<p>Though late last year he decided to get back to his roots, music. Fieldhouse was the first artist he wanted to collaborate with on a project.“Around the same time, [Fieldhouse] had asked me if I could get him a feature with Conway as I had just done a video for him,” he says. “I hit up Conway and he was on board, but he said ‘only you can shoot the video.’”That video, as well as others, are in the works according to DL.https://youtu.be/VYGBM7ib7Mo“Griselda brought back that specific sound that hip hop was missing, so I instantly wanted to work with them,” he adds, noting that he had previously produced a record featuring Benny the Butcher.“Fieldhouse and I are currently brainstorming the next single to drop and who should join us,” he says. “I am personally sitting on a goldmine of golden era collabs from artists like B-Real, Smif-N-Wessun, Onyx, Kool G Rap and a few dozen more.”Fieldhouse and Myster DL’s as of yet untitled EP is coming soon.</p>
