  <h1>Dead Rep -- Rake Cat</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Dead Reputation, the trio of  22-year-old NXUS, Delirious Beats (producer/engineer) and Rake (writer/videographer/film editor/photographer), certainly have a lot going for them.</p><p>They have the type of sound and imagery that gives writers like me what can only be described as a "writer boner." Self-professed semi-conscious hip hop, you can feel the aura of these cats, and can pretty much deduce it's only a matter of time.</p><p>Their latest song/video, "Rake Cat," is dark, lyrical, and fun to watch.</p><p>In case you missed it, their previous video "Scopolamine" had over 100-thousand hits on Youtube.</p><p>After you're done with the latest from Dead Rep, you'll want to check out NXUS' latest EP, the six-track <em>Bando Music The Tales Of Peter Pyraxx</em>. "Recycle Raps," and "Foreign," should find their way on to your playlist this week.</p><p>While he only started recording a couple of years ago, NXUS has written hundreds of songs and hired out as an industry ghostwriter.</p><p>NXUS and his circle are definitely on the road to the riches; keep your eyes and ears ready.</p><p>You heard it here first!
