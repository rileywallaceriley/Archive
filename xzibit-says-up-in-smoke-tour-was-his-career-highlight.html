    <div class="content"><p>In the upcoming new episode of Crook’s Corner, KXNG Crooked sits down with veteran West Coast rapper, actor and entrepreneur Xzibit.In this bonus clip, Xzibit recounts his experience on 2000’s Up In Smoke Tour, which was headlined by Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre — and featured Eminem and Ice Cube.“It was the highlight of my career still to this day,” he says of the iconic tour. “I've had some real peaks and that was definitely the highest.”While Xzibit says there was ample preparation for the show, it wasn’t until the opening night the grandeur of the moment hit him.“It wasn't real until we rolled out on that stage," he explained. "I went out there and I could look at the crowd and I had Dr. Dre right here, I had Eminem right here ... [Snoop Dogg and I had just got off the low riding bikes doing 'Bitch Please.' “I come from reading the back of these dudes CDs and just reading the credits and looking at them on videos, to be considered one of them and be on the front line with them ... [having them] see the value of me being there. I couldn't explain it any other way except, wow, this is it.</p>
<p>This is like being on the muthafuckin' Lakers with Shaq and Kobe.”https://youtu.be/lfA6jewSunUThe Up In Smoke Tour kicked off June 15, 2000, in Chula Vista, California and ended 44 dates later in Greenwood Village, Colorado.
