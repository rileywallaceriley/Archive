  <h1>Big Pun – Bronx Legends Never Die</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><p class="p1">Last night when I made my way to my mailbox I had only one thing on my mind – Big Pun.</p><p>A week earlier, after hitting up producer Domingo on Twitter, I was about to receive a <a href="https://twitter.com/AboveAverageHH/status/552822509847216128/photo/1">USB key with a WAV version of his new Big Pun EP</a> <em>Bronx Legends Never Die</em>, the first official (Rios family sanctioned) Big Pun release since 2000’s <em>Yeah Baby</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Being Latin, everybody has their idols in Hip Hop and it’s definitely not a biased thing but people idolized Biggie or they idolized Pac and people do idolize Pun but being that I’m Latin… Latin people hold Pun on this pedestal but I feel that his legacy doesn’t get pushed enough.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>- Domingo discussing his motivation for the EP (BREAL TV)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">The EP had a limited CD release of only 350, which Domingo pre-sold as part of an indiegogo campaign.</p><p>Unfortunately I missed the boat, but was excited that domingo was willing to ship a USB.</p><p>After unpacking and booting up my PC I finally pressed play – wow!</p><p>This isn’t an over-produced posthumous release that many legends have suffered, this is a raw, hip-hop project that Pun would be proud of.</p>
<p class="p1">The EP features remixes/reworks and a few new/unreleased tracks – namely <em>From the X</em> and the epic <em>Lyrically Fit</em>. the latter features not only Shaq, Cormega and Easy Mo Bee , but also Pun’s son <a title="Meet Chris Rivers, Son Of The Late Great Big Pun" href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/meet-chris-rivers-son-late-great-big-pun/">Chris Rivers</a> who comes in right after his father.</p><p>Another big tune is Symphony 2000 featuring Kool G Rap, Truck Turner and KRS One.</p><p>The remixes, as well, are ridiculous – you need Domingo’s Dream Shatterer remix in your life (trust me).</p>
<p class="p1">The EP also includes some production from the infamous Dr.G, who has produced for Wu-Tang, Kool G Rap and more – and Domingo (if you aren’t familiar) is a legend in his own right.</p><p>You should cruise through his <a href="http://domingobeats.com/discography/">discography</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Probably the most engaging (and touching) part of the EP are the memories that were shared by Pun fans.</p><p>Domingo asked fans to be a part of this project and they supplied him with drops via Facebook.</p><p>This is (overall) a great listen – highly recommended for old and new fans alike.</p><p>It will be available on I-Tunes January 18th.</p><p>Go support great music!</p>
