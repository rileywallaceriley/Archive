    <div class="content"><p>James Harden and the Houston Rockets played host the Los Angeles Lakers yesterday December 13 at the Houston Toyota Center. Although Rockets were victorious at 126-111, thanks in part to Lakers letting Harden camp out at the free throw line, the real story was Harden’s pregame outfit — the latest entry in the NBA short suit saga.https://youtube.com/watch?v=NbQPtUPu2V8During pre-game coverage on NBA On TNT, Charles Barkley took one look at Harden’s snake-skin suit and short and loudly interrupted with “Oh my god, are you kidding me?”“Ain’t no snake that color,” he added amid his co-hosts overusing the word drip — even definitively stating that he “drips too hard.”Meek Mill was even clowning the outfit on Instagram, noting “I just talked to chief he said that ain’t it bro.”Dripping aside, Harden played a hell of a game, earning his 37th career triple-double — and his second triple-double of the season.</p>
<p>He is now responsible for the most 50-point triple-doubles in NBA history.</p></div>
