  <h1>Rare Hip-Hop You Probably Won't Ever Hear</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>In a recent interview, legendary DJ Clark Kent revealed that BK -- and contemporary hip-hop -- icon Jay-Z recorded a scathing diss record towards Tupac.</p><p>At the climax of the East/West storm, Pac went on a rampage, dropping a barrage of strongly worded shade towards New York artists, including Biggie, Mobb Deep, and Jigga himself.</p><p>According to Clark, Jay went full ether on Pac; unfortunately, though, Pac was murdered before the record saw the light of day.</p><p>Clark mentioned that he was reluctant to put his hands on the record at the time.</p><p>Because he knew, he'd be unable to hold it back.</p><p>Can you imagine?</p><p>Well, this story got us thinking about some of the other great Holy Grail hip-hop that we've never heard.</p><p>We've rounded up some of it below, for you reading pleasure.</p><p>Happy treasure hunting!

<strong>Method Man's Original <em>Tical</em> album
</strong>
In the early days of Wu-Tang Clan, Method Man was undeniably a breakout star.</p><p>With the record "Method Man" serving as the sole solo record on the Clan's game-changing debut, the stage was set for his breakout Def Jam debut album.</p><p>As the story goes, a reported 15 of the original beats by RZA slated for Tical -- amongst other things -- were lost when the 36 Chambers Studio was flooded in late 1993.</p><p>As a result, most of the albums production was hastily rushed to meet deadlines while juggling a hectic tour schedule.</p><p>The result was a classic album that upon it's released cracked top 5 on Billboard; but, can you imagine the heat he lost?</p><p>Wow.</p><p>We'll never know what the album could have been if his original vision had been realized.

<strong>Cassette Copy of Snoop's  Debut
</strong>
Before Doggystyle, there was <em>Over The Counter</em>, which was meant to be not only the debut album from Snoop Doggy Dogg but for the entire Death Row brand (rather than the Chronic).</p><p>With features from usual suspects as well as George Clinton, the album was set to go; unfortunately, due financial restraints the album, which was already pressed, never saw the light of day.</p><p>It was heavily bootlegged after the fact, but fact checkers were quick to note that cassette copies floating around included a photo that wasn't snapped until two years later, and improperly listed label credits.</p><p>The truth is, there is likely only a few legitimate copies of this physical tape  in actual existence -- if it exists at all.</p><p>Those curious can settle for terribly dubbed snippets on YouTube.

<strong>MC Hammer and 2Pac collabration On <em>Too Tight</em>
</strong>
Remember when Hammer signed to Deathrow?</p><p>Yeah, I know, right?</p><p>Well, he recorded a gang of material for the ill-fated -- and terribly named -- Too Tight, which like many Row projects during that period, never can to commercial fruition.</p><p>Here's the thing, though, there were features from Tupac on the record; in fact, some sources say there may have been upwards of three.</p><p>Luckily one of the tracks has since surfaced on YouTube, but not all of them!</p><p>Hammer is very kitschy, no doubt about it, but he holds a special place in the hearts of some.</p><p>As if you wouldn't be interested in hearing these unreleased collaborations.</p><p>Stop it 5!

2Pac and Boot Camp Clik Come Together As <em>One Nation</em>

Tupac burned many bridges in the East leading up to his death; although, he had a lot of love for the big apple -- and he planned to show this to the world with his One Nation project -- a collaboration with the Boot Camp Clik.</p><p>The whole Duck Down staff paid a visit to PAC summer mansion, and recorded stacks of material; however, a month later Pac was murdered, putting the record in limbo, indefinitely.</p><p>Words can't describe how dope and utterly significant this project would have been.</p><p>A few of the joints have leaked on the net, but the vault is still full!

Mystery Jay-Z Reasonable Doubt Records

After his original demo tapes leaked, we all kind of thought that we'd heard every Jay-Z record ever.</p><p>Then Adrien Vargas, the album's art director, and designer, dropped a bomb on the web, an original track listing that included three additional tracks that we've never heard.</p><p>That raised a whole gang of questions.</p><p>Have we heard these songs, just with different names?</p><p>Are these songs sitting on some reels in Dame Dash's basement?</p><p>Unfortunately, there are no answers.</p><p>Die hard fans can only hope that Jigga decides to pull a Nas and drop lost tapes some day.
