  <h1>#IndieSpotlight: Vas Leon Impresses With A Deluxe Version Of His Album 'Krossover'</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>We <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/vas-leon-is-beyond-active-going-into-2017/">shared a record with you late last year by a London artist by the name of Vas Leon</a>.</p><p>What's unique about him is that unlike some of the overseas hype we feature here on the site, Vas has strong ties out here, as a member of the Miami-based collective GTPS.</p><p>He's also been  about that tour life, rocking stages across the nation as well as in the UK; he even toured with the highly respected Fat Boy Slim, which gave him a ton of exposure.</p><p>He dropped his album, Krossover, last September to much acclaim, landing himself on the UK Hip Hop Charts.</p><p>Recently, though, he dropped a deluxe version of the project, with the addition of five new records.</p><p>As I missed the train the first trip, this was an excellent opportunity to see what I've been missing out on.</p><p>I pressed play, and here's what happened.</p><p>Off the jump, the project--which is entire self-produced BTW--has a very epic grandeur about it.</p><p>From the opening bars, "if they tell me no, then I say why" you get the sense that Vas is all in.</p><p>This is echoed throughout all 19 tracks; it's a long listen, but it doesn't feel that way.</p><p>Like a Peter Jackson film.</p><p>He moonwalks through two overarching themes that steer the vibe of the project, love and proving people wrong.</p><p>He kind of attacks the first idea from multiple angles, like "The Vibe," which plays like a lyrical promise ring to the most important woman in his life.</p><p>Then, in an almost opposite stance, he proclaims that he's still "A Player For Life," but willing to change.</p><p>He also takes a third-party/advisory role on the "Problems Interlude."

The new records available on this deluxe version--for the most part-- were my favorite records on the project.</p><p>His literal crossover appeal is evident, and he speaks at lengths about it throughout numerous tracks, but he has bars; on the second track, "Lyrical Slaughter," he describes it as having "two minds." On the come up record, "My Life," he drops gems like "no homo, but this song is like a mandate," amidst a declaration of how he put his all into this music.</p><p>My two absolute highlights, though, are the single/video, "I'm Reborn," which is a theme song of a grinder/dreamer, and "Away," a relatable record about a lost love that he still can't quite come to terms with.</p><p>Overall, the record is an incredibly strong effort--and that's without the deluxe version songs.</p><p>All the hype I've heard/seen seems to have been justified.</p><p>Krossover does a great job of taking UK grime/aesthetic and making it universally relatable and digestible.</p><p>If you've been sleeping, wake up!
