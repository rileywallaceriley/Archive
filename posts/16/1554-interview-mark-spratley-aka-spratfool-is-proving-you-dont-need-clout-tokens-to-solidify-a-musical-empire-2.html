<strong>You've been in the music industry for only five years and have already created something massive.</p><p>How did you do it and what is planned for the future?</strong>

Countless hours, grind, plotting and studying.</p><p>I've learned, and LVL'd UP.</p><p>That's it.</p><p>I knew if I put in the work, I would find a way.</p><p>I go 3000% for whatever I do or whoever I work with.</p><p>Some people make the same moves and expect things to change.</p><p>Some people aren't willing to starve to binge forever.</p><p>I'm out here mastering and succeeding at whatever I do.</p><p>I make sure of it.</p><p>I've got an insane ear for music, that's been known.</p><p>That's why some of your favorite A&amp;R's would be asking me to pull up to their office on the regular.</p><p>I'm here to take over though.</p><p>I'm going to continue to put people into position and maintain my brand.</p><p>The empire is forming; the foundation has been laid and built.

<strong>We recently saw in another interview that you have a new platform on the way?</p><p>What're the details on that? (If you can give us any)</strong>

NEW DAY, NEW WAVE (LITERALLY).</p><p>Zias (Popular youtube star &amp;influencer) and I are partnering up on a new media outlet x platform for something special.</p><p>We're about to surpass the field quick.</p><p>Two powerful influencers, we already got the traffic between both of us, both widely connected.</p><p>Run it up!</p><p>Bunch of content on the way from both of us

<strong>If you could tell someone looking to get into the industry one piece of advice, what would it be?</strong>

GRIND SMART.</p><p>Bring something to the table.</p><p>Your passion and time can go a long way.</p><p>Learn.</p><p>Be willing to do what the next man is not.</p><p>Do you know how much free time and work I gave out to get to where I am now?!</p><p>Now my time costs.</p><p>Money isn't everything, in the beginning, work for your opportunity.</p><p>People worried about $20-$5000 (Short term money) when sometimes you just need to see the bigger picture.</p><p>You wouldn't want everyone to bring ketchup to the BBQ; you need someone to bring the bun, the burger, the juice, the drink and everything else.</p><p>Do you feel me?!</p><p>Same goes for the industry or any job you do in life.</p><p>Bring something different to the table and create a demand for it.</p><p>That's when you create stock for yourself (You create worth).

<strong>What were you doing before becoming a music mogul?</strong>

I was doing the school thing before I decided to leave for music full time.</p><p>I was making money however I needed to.

<strong>What new artists do you have your eye on?</strong>

NEW SIGNINGS on the way.</p><p>I'm getting back in my artist bag 3000%.</p><p>Look out for all of that.</p><p>I got to hold my list down for the time being.

<strong>How did you get into PR?</strong>

Fresh Moss and Neako had me on a lot of PR type of moves early.</p><p>I always studied and noticed was going on in the game.</p><p>Got tired of hitting up a lot of these foolish and corny "Bloggers" and people that were out and around at the time that felt entitled.</p><p>A lot of them aren't even around anymore haha.</p><p>Many didn't want to see someone else moving faster or making something out of all this.</p><p>I decided to take everything into my own hands.</p><p>From then on I turned this PR wave into something masterful.</p><p>Countless artists have popped off since through my PR, their ability and me connecting these dots on the daily.

<strong>Top 5 modern artists most likely in your daily music mix?</strong>

It all depends on the day and mood

Lately...</p><p>DaBaby, pre kai ro, Lil Baby, YNW Melly, Stunna 4 Vegas &amp; DaiDough.</p><p>I've been bumping FBG Duck heavily as of late; bro got energy.

<strong>A few artists are rising out of New Jersey that you've been alerting us about for over a year or 2.</p><p>From Daidough to Coi Leray and many more.</p><p>New Jersey has some talent for sure, how do you think your state will hold up in 2019?</strong>

New Jersey is UP right now, and it's only going to get crazier.</p><p>A lot of artists doing their thing.</p><p>Daidough got home and been going stupid.</p><p>Coi Leray has been spazzing since G.A.N.

Albee Al doing him as always, Tsu Surf home and just dropped a fire project, Arsonal on damn TV, Fatboy SSE is outta here and in his lane, Mir Fontane been putting in work.</p><p>Jersey got a wide variety of sounds, every city/town is different, North and South Jersey completely different.</p><p>Beyond the artists, there are so many talented people coming up out of NJ and doing their thing in this music industry or elsewhere.</p><p>It's great to see people winning from your home state.

<strong>We remember you going crazy at SXSW with Smooky Margielaa a few years back when he was only an artist with a 10k following, how did you all meet?</strong>

Shit, my man Mike had told me I had to bump something while we were in LA.</p><p>The track happened to be 'Layed up,' heard it and it was a wrap for me.</p><p>His mans was GRAPE, we were all in LA, so we all linked up at the apartment, vibed and got to work immediately.</p><p>Started putting in that push, went to SXSW and went full force after SXSW.</p><p>Glad to see Smooky up right now.

<strong>We dove into your Twitter and did a little google search on you while doing some more research.</p><p>We saw you got into it a little with Akademiks online last year?</p><p>LOL, tell us more?</strong>

LMAO!</p><p>If you did some research like you said I'm sure you know what was said.</p><p>Jersey people certainly don't tolerate bullshit.</p><p>I called BS on something he spoke on.</p><p>Jersey got behind it.</p><p>That's it.

<strong>What ever happened to Nikko Lafre? </strong>

Man, I can't speak on another man that's not with me.</p><p>We had something crazy growing, that's where I'm going to leave it.</p><p>Drew Love out here winning though with THEY, Lee Beats out here winning, Johnny Rain out here still doing his thing up.

<strong>Thoughts on R Kelly latest situation and documentary? </strong>

SHEESH!</p><p>I don't want to believe it, but it's their right before our eyes.</p><p>It's a shame because his music and voice are legendary.</p><p>I feel as though 60 Minutes would have been a more credible platform to present this problem to the world instead of a Lifetime documentary.</p><p>I'd like to hear R Kelly voice his defense for sure, but regardless his actions are sickening.</p><p>We'll see how it taints his legacy, it is 2019 so who knows.

<strong>2019 plans?</strong>

REGULATE
