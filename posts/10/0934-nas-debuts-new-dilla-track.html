  <div class="content"><p>Last night Nas made a surprise appearance at a <a href="https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCUQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.runthejewels.net%2F&amp;ei=AV1SVNC3As-tyAS2yICACw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFVULa8rAf7KGtngC5FMz8KaMRW4Q&amp;sig2=Cz9sZ4Cl82IEQgu4vHwB0w&amp;bvm=bv.78597519,d.aWw"><em>Run the Jewels</em></a> Q&amp;A event.</p><p>After congratulating the duo, and with no obvious objection from El-P or Killer Mike, he proceeded to bless the audience with a new track called <em>The Season</em>– which in itself wasn't left-field.</p><p>He'd mentioned a short while ago during an <a href=" Martinez interview</a> that he planned on dropping something soon.</p><p>The pleasant surprise, aside from the obvious, was that the track he played a snippet of was produced by the late great J-Dilla.</p><p>Over the <a href=" instrumental that appeared on Dilla's <em>Donuts</em> album, Nas drops some pretty serious bars.</p><p>Check the track yourself after the jump.
