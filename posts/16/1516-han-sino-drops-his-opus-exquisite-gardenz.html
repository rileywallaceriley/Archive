  <h1>Han Sino Drops His Opus 'Exquisite Gardenz'</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>There is something inherently perfect about the right soundtrack for your movements at the right time.</p><p>In a wave of commercial Hip Hop -- with the genre being at its absolute height regarding actual quantifiable popularity -- it may be hard to explain to someone why instrumental LPs are so vital for your soul.</p><p>But in the word of King Push: "if you know you know."

I continuously thirst for new instrumental soundtracks, and French producer/poet/creative Han Sino is someone that I've covered in the past -- in particular his project titled <em>Glucose</em>.</p><p>He creates this refreshing blend of funk grooves, jazz, ambient hip-hop, and atmospheric melodies that seriously make for a trippy experience, dependant on how you consume his ambitious projects.

His latest output, <em>Exquisite </em>Gardenz, is one which Han himself considers to be his opus.</p><p>Much like his previous release -- during my first few listens, I noticed that the core bass lines created that signature continuous flow that moved the 12-song soundscape along.</p><p>The best way to describe this project is that if a crate digger were to randomly come across this during a record shop excursion, and take it home and drop the needle anywhere, they'd be excited as hell to fire up the MPC and start chopping.</p><p>It's gorgeous.</p><p>Beginning with the atmospheric intro track "Exquisite," we're introduced to an Asian influence that creeps in throughout the project.</p><p>The second track "Red Fishes" gave me chills off the top, as the bassline was reminiscent of the iconic bass strums from Eric B. &amp; Rakim's "Don't Sweat The Technique." Rather than commit to a hip-hop-centric platter, though, it expands into this difficult to describe Sunday afternoon, soulful, 70's vibe -- accentuated with these ambient wind chimes that make for a crazy audio trip.</p><p>Later on in the tracklist, I found myself drawn to the mysterious vibe of "Deep Lagoonz," with an almost video game vibe, set-off with this super cool flute, and some frantic strings that add this odd amount of tension to track.</p><p>The strings in the album closer "Gardenz" also had me intrigued; groovy, jazzy, and insanely engrossing.</p><p>As Han himself says in the album's liner notes, "I hope you will  this Opus as a proposition to see life differently, and bite it to the fullest ... drunk of the liquor of paradise." This should be the goal of any great instrumental affair -- a soundtrack to the movie that is your life; whether you're getting lost in a world of writing or banging it which you're trekking through the metropolis after dark. <em>Exquisite Gardenz</em> is a beautiful body of work.</p><p>If you're into nu jazz, rare groove, or a fan of instrumental hip-hop, you'll want to give it a spin.
