<p>UK producer <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/uk-producer-big-o-returns-with-instability-lp/">Big O</a>, during one of the most creatively draining periods in modern human history, managed to stay busy.</p><p>He dropped a few highly recommended collaborative LPs: <em><a href="https://big-o.bandcamp.com/album/ocean-grown">Ocean Grown</a></em> with Loki Loko and a deluxe version of <em><a href="https://big-o.bandcamp.com/album/a-new-day-deluxe-version">A New Day</a></em> with Dankery Harv.</p><p>That on top of a handful of and a pretty knocking instrumental EP, <em><a href="https://big-o.bandcamp.com/album/parking-violations-ep-instrumentals">Parking Violations</a></em>.</p><p>However, the best still may be yet to come, as a brand new single titled “The Preordained” with South Side Jamaica Queens MC L.O.U. signals a sophomore effort heads may want to keep an eye out for; let me explain.</p>

<p>L.O.U. and Big O first connecting about three years ago on this gem of a project titled <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6TiT3JMcPfWBIJg3ybKc7E">The South Side Of Things</a></em>.</p><p>Anyone who knows me knows my affinity for Brooklyn luminary Skyzoo, who appears on the track “Who Would’ve Thought,” off the said project.</p><p>That was a gateway into L.O.U., and a thorough top to bottom at the time showed gobs of promise, with the Queens wordsmith penning an incredibly thoughtful body of work — traversing everything from his upbringing to his rocky relationship with his parents.</p><p>It was relatable, and I saw him catch a stride.</p>

<p>The project was a sleeper — a status only bolstered by what seemed like radio silence since 2018.</p><p>But this new track, “The Preordained,” is impressive.</p><p>I made it the soundtrack of a night run around my city and found myself lost in its compelling vibe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It follows a similar structural path of some of the more intriguing tracks off his past work, going off with no hook over Big O’s moody production that gives off these cinematic feels.</p><p>It’s decidedly darker in tone, at points more aggressive, as he describes premonitions of death and skating through the grimy side of things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Still, he’s maintaining a confident demeanor; there is one bar where he describes his 2020 flow as being like water — which is a great way to describe it.</p><p>He and Big O feel like Peanut Butter and Jelly, and this direction harkens to a sound that is shying away from the more mainstream aesthetic currently coming out of New York.</p><p>It finds itself more so riding the underground wave presently making its way through the current landscape.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With an inevitable sophomore from the two on the horizon, his absence begs many questions, and this new single seems to signify that he was living life in the downtime; his style has become even more fluid, and this particular soundscape fits him like a glove.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Big O makes excellent music, and not only does this song seem to signify an LP full of quotables and back button mashers on L.O.U.’s part, but also a sign that O isn’t here to play around.</p>
