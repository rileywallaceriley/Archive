Sands of Lone Catalysts, Jorun Bombay, production duo The Ruckazoid and Teeko, and Seattle beatmaker BeanOne.In a separate tweet, he referenced a previously released song called “Just Cause” featuring Robert Glasper that would also be appearing on one of the two projects.Listen to Dres' singles below.https://soundcloud.com/poolofgenius/black-sheep-dres-patience-tortured-soul-mixtape-teeko-ruckazoidhttps://soundcloud.com/poolofgenius/just-cause</p></div>
