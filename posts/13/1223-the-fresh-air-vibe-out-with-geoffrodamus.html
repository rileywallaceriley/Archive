A new album made its way across my desk today, all the way from Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p><p>A young rapper by the name of Geoffrodamus -- just trying to get his name out there.</p><p>The project is called <i>The Fresh Air EP</i>; with a running time of only 19 minutes, it's succinct, but devoid of too much filler.</p><p>Sonically, it's a blend of soulful samples, dark Tyler The Creator-esque production aesthetic, and an admirable amount of slow-flow truth and substance.</p><p>I'm always down to support these young cats that drop records without conforming to the yawn-inspiring trap-wave currently running the scene.</p><p>With more and more emphasis on bars, and the game  beginning to regress back to a skills-first mentality, this kid may just have the right idea.</p><p>Content-wise, it's a blend on very short 1-2 verse records and interlude type joints, with some pretty heavy stuff. "Let's Be Real," for example, sees him touching on his drug abuse, his  fuelled thoughts of suicide, his rocky relationship with his son's mother -- and more.</p><p>I was rocking this on shuffle (by accident) and listening to this joint first left me in awe of how honest/open he was, without seeming phony.</p><p>He reminisces back to his pre-fatherhood life on the track "Oldies, " and gets busy on a super bassy  Mary J Blige sample on "505 Flows." He hits his stride on the vibed out Outro -- which sports production reminiscent of the early solo days of Erick Sermon.</p><p>Honesty, substance, realness, bars and hella bass -- that's what this EP delivers.</p><p>With only two years in, Geoffrodamus shows some great promise and a good ear for production.</p><p>Keep this kid on your radar -- and we'll be sure to keep you up to date on his latest ish as it becomes available.</p><p>Early.
