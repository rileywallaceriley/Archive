  <h1>Coastal Trolling: Detroit Vs Everybody</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Hip-hop has an incessant need to one-up.</p><p>Sometimes this becomes frustrating to sit through as it often translates to simply following suit until it becomes overly redundant.</p><p>A few examples being the <em><a href="http://youtu.be/pBXniiEgmMk">Hot Nigga</a></em> phenomenon that spawned literally a million versions with accompanying videos and <em><a href="http://youtu.be/AAbi1494n0M">Chi-Raq</a></em> that become old fast as rapper after rapper made odes to their set over the Lil'Herb/Nicki Minaj song of the same name.</p><p>We can also mention the cypher, made popular by BET as a device to boost ratings for the annual award show.</p><p>That concept spawned an unbelievable amount of cyphers  – filmed in black and white of course.

Every once and a while one of these phenomenons have the potential to shake up and excite the game.</p><p>Remember when Kendrick Lamar slapped every single NYC rapper in the face then proceeded to call out everyone?</p><p>That type of challenge to "<em>step up your game</em>" can sometimes be what the industry needs.</p><p>Something that keeps fans glued to the internet feverishly waiting for responses from their fave emcees.</p><p>As of last week, it seems as though we may have our next big thing.</p><p>As part of the Shady XV, Eminem released <em><a href="http://youtu.be/vjUgJ6Cw5PU">Detroit vs Everybody</a></em>, a Detroit anthem featuring Royce The 5'9, Big Sean and Danny Brown.</p><p>The outro features D-town bully Trick-Trick telling Marshall he's taking the beat to the hood to get that "fire remix".</p><p>The excitement started to build as Snoop Doggy Dogg posted artwork on his Instagram for <em>Los Angeles vs Everybody</em> – a potential answer to the latter.</p><p>Where will this end up?</p><p>We predict a New York vs Everyone, Chicago vs Everyone, Atlanta vs Everyone – and so on and so on.</p><p>It's only a matter of time before it gets out of hand, but for the time being, we're excited!</p><p>What potential line-ups would you like to see?</p><p>Note we made that NYC line-up ourselves.
