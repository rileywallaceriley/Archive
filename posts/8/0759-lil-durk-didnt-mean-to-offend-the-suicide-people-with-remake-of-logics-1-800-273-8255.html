  <div class="content"><p>Chicago rapper Lil Durk has been incredibly active over the last three years — dropping two studio albums and six mixtapes.</p><p>Still, his core fans have still been pressing him for the third installment of his Signed To The Streets mixtape series — the second of which dropped in the summer of 2014.He teased its release last October with Signed To The Streets 2.5, but he gave a more accurate preview of what's to come on January 11 when he dropped "1 (773) VULTURE," a more "street" take on Logic's "1-800-273-8255." Logic's song — a suicide-prevention awareness anthem featuring Alessia Cara and Khalid -- was nominated for Song of the Year at the 2018 Grammys and has been generally praised for its message and impact. version offers a starkly different perspective. "It's gon' be a homicide, fuck with Durk and they dying today," he sings on the chorus of the song, using the same melody as the original.</p><p>After hearing what many have dubbed a "homicide version," some fans reacted negatively via Twitter.Aware of the feedback, Durk took to Twitter to clarify his intentions, noting that it was never his intention to show "disrespect to the suicide people."However, his fans — many of which seem to not be big on Logic — didn't see any issue with him using the same instrumental to share his version of reality.Durk also recently posted an image to Instagram of himself on his phone with the caption, "Texting logic telling him i did the remix for the trenches #1773vulture and i love em."</p></div>
