    <div class="content"><p>While some artists have shied away from dropping new releases this week out of respect for Nipsey Hussle, who was murdered in L.A. on Sunday (March 31), Griselda’s crown jewel Conway The Machine has taken a different approach.“I had to take my mind off that sucka shit that happened to the homie ... I dropped some pain for the pain,” he wrote in an Instagram caption promoting his latest release Everybody Is F.O.O.D. 3.He first teased the eight-song EP on March 31, noting that he recorded it in just two days.“I recorded this tape in 2 days to show niggas that im the illest and it came out effortlessly INCREDIBLE,” he stated.“This the hardest shit this year so far and I'm far from finished,” he added — alluding to the numerous projects the Griselda imprint has promised in 2019, including Conway’s Shady Records debut.Stream Conway The Machine’s Everybody Is F.O.O.D. 3, below.https://open.spotify.com/album/7wZmVoR11jHhE9PzZbc100?si=ChS2Y3sBSri-9iVwvJx0NQ</p></div>
