<strong>How did you get involved in music?</strong>

Been rapping since junior year in high school, but just started taking it serious this past summer as far as pushing music towards blogs and networking with industry people.

<strong>Who are some of your influences?</strong>

Influenced by a lot of 90s NY hip hop figures such as: Raekwon, Nas, Hov, Big Pun and AZ.</p><p>I try to tell a story and share a message in my music – I'm not a big fan of the "money, bitches and swag" rap.</p><p>I always keep it real in my bars no fairy tale ish.

<strong>Tell me about your music.</strong>

As far as my sound goes, I just spit don't try to sound like anyone, but a lot of people tell me I sound like Killa Cam and Raekwon – I don't see it tho.</p><p>I'm currently working on building my buzz and gettin my name out there.</p><p>God willing, I would like to drop a project by the summer time.

<strong>What are your fave albums ever?</strong>

Favourite albums hands down are O<em>nly Built For Cuban Linx</em> &amp; <em>Illmatic</em>.
