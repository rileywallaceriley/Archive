  <h1>#IndieSpotlight: Shah33d Discusses His New Ep</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Sometimes, an affinity for music can truly run in your blood; such is the case for artist Shah33d.</p><p>His grandfather was Lawrence Payton, who was 1/4 of the original Four Tops — one of the most significant groups in not just the Motown era, but also music history. "He got to me to be interested in music ...</p><p>I was writing at an early age," he told AAHH.</p><p>He recently released a brand new EP, which he's currently promoting.</p><p>It's a solid collection, with some dope production; in fact, one of the producers he worked with was J-Louis, who is the official DJ for Bryson Tiller, whose latest album is slaying Billboard charts.</p><p>He sat exclusively with AAHH to chat about his music, career, and more.</p><p>Check it out below.



<b>So you just dropped a project a few weeks ago.</p><p>Tell me about the mantra behind it.</b>

My latest project is called One Day At A Time, and it simply represents just that.</p><p>For me being an artist, I don't like just to put music out to keep up with the current trends.</p><p>For me, I felt like I have to be different — you know, inspired.</p><p>So, this album is just a compilation of a bunch of experiences that I went through.I was able to put it out on wax.</p><p>It took me roughly about six months to complete the project, because I wanted to make sure everything was tight, and that it was relevant and made sense to me.</p><p>Hopefully, it's relative to listeners.</p><p>I'm shooting a video for every song on EP.</p><p>You know it's all about visuals; I already have one video for one of the songs called "Claimed It." I dropped it in March.

<b>Is this your first EP?</b>

This is my first official EP that's being released to streaming platforms.</p><p>I released an EP back in 2012 just to get a feel for everything — It's called the "Reflection." It was a decent project, you know it built up a fanbase, and it got me on the path I need to go.</p><p>But this one is the official project that was released on all digital platforms, Apple music and so on and so forth.

<b>What are your thoughts on the current state of the music industry?</p><p>Maybe some loading questions?</b>

I think that it's not balanced.</p><p>You turn on a radio, you hear the same top twenty artists — when there are millions of artists who are releasing music on a regular basis.</p><p>In my opinion, I feel that there is a niche for every artist.</p><p>If If you are a trap artist, there is a niche for you.</p><p>If you are a spiritual artist, there is a niche for you.</p><p>Whatever you do, there is a niche for you; but I feel like the state of hip-hop is only pushing one avenue and right now.</p><p>The trend is the mumble rap.</p><p>And you know, I don't knock the mumble rappers, that's cool.</p><p>You know that's just the niche for them.</p><p>And I feel like the music industry is doing a terrible job at balancing.

<b>What would you say is your goal in the music industry; what is it that you want to achieve in your career?</b>

My goal is to go as far as the music will allow me.</p><p>Featuring on major label artist songs, a couple of Grammys later on down the road; To just get the message out that you can be — you can be yourself without compromising who you are — and still be successful.</p><p>As long as I get that message out, I'll feel like a part of my mission is complete.</p><p>And you know, just to have fun while doing it.</p></div>
