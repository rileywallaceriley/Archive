<p>New episodes will be released each Wednesday on Spotify.The show's first season highlighted the life of legendary music industry veteran Chris Lighty, and season two took listeners through the story of Miami's rap scene by looking at the group 2 Live Crew.Catch a preview of Mogul's The Mogul Mixtapes series below, and catch the first episode, featuring Mouse Jones, on Spotify.</p></div>
