  <h1>20 Of JAY-Z's Biggest Bars From "4:44"</h1>
  <div class="meta">2017-07-02 — editorials</div>
  <div class="content"><p>2017 has had plenty of reasons to look forward to New Release Friday.</p><p>But only a few drops effectively had fans up at midnight collectively experiencing new music as a culture.</p><p>Kendrick Lamar did it with DAMN., and this past Friday (June 30) JAY-Z released his fabled 4:44, taking over social media as fans gave it a hard listen.</p><p>By nearly all accounts, it delivered on all fronts.Amid soundscapes orchestrated by chronically underrated producer No I.D., Jay delivered focused, age-appropriate bars that many have compared to his Blueprint era.With little wasted space, Jay's lyrics are dense throughout the 10-song TIDAL-released LP, and take a few listens to catch some of the most intricate references.</p><p>Deeply personal at points, he takes straight shots and reminds listeners why heads back in 1996 were arguing all day about "Who's the best MCs, Biggie, Jay-Z, or Nas?"Not only did he make clear his feelings about Kanye and the coordinators of the late Prince's estate, he even added to the Lemonade narrative and hilariously referenced Eric Benét — prompting a response on Twitter.</p><p>And that doesn't even scratch the surface.After a few listens, we've narrowed down our Top 20 bars from the album.</p><p>Which lines were you feeling?</p><p>Let us know in the comments below."Kill Jay Z""You gave him 20 million without thinkin'/ He gave you 20 minutes on stage, fuck was he thinkin'?/ 'Fuck wrong with everybody?'
