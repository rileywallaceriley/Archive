<strong>How did you get into the game?</strong>
 
I started out freestyling with my friends in high school which led to me doing battle rap for a few years.</p><p>I won some big battles in Toronto and then started putting out music independently.
 
<strong>Who were some of your influences coming up?</strong>
 
I use to listen to a lot of Big Pun, Tupac, and Eminem.</p><p>Rappers like Fabolous and Jadakiss also inspired my style a lot.</p><p>Before rap, I listened to a bit of rock too.
 
<strong>I hear you’re headed to LA; what are your plans out there?
 </strong>
I can’t wait to get back to the lab and work with producers I met while working out there.</p><p>I also plan on shooting a bunch of new videos and stopping by some radio stations.</p><p>Check out my last interview and freestyle on dash radio.
 
<strong>Let’s chat about your latest video; how did you connect with Louie Rankin?</strong>
 
Louie is an OG, and he's always in Toronto.</p><p>We got to link up one day, and I played him the song.</p><p>He started spazzing so when I thought of the concept I knew he would be dope to kick it off.
 
<strong>Is there a project in the works?</strong>
 
My mixtape is coming out this summer.</p><p>It got a lot of different sounds and collabs on there.</p><p>I'm super excited for my fans to hear what I have been cooking up in the past year.
 
<strong>Tell me more about <em>The Dispensary</em>.</strong>
 
The tape features Zoey Dollaz, Lil Duke, Big Lean, 808 Mafia, Arrabmuzuk and more.</p><p>I also have a clothing line called the Dispensary which im pushing alongside the tape.</p><p>Look out for an official release date and release parties in a city near you.
 
<strong>Canada is about to legalize weed: thoughts?</strong>
 
I think it’s about goddamn time.</p><p>The movement has been stable for ten plus years now, and I'm happy to see people not having to face charges and worry about going to jail for weed.</p><p>Hopefully, the government here in Canada can figure out a good system to distribute it and still offer good quality at a reasonable price to the consumer.
 
<strong>Any last words?</strong>
