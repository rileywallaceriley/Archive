    <h1>10 Pre-Twitter Songs That Would Have Driven The Timeline Crazy</h1>
    <div class="meta">2018-10-21 — editorials</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Hip Hop Twitter lives for outrage. While usually warranted, it’s often laughably tame if we stop to consider some of the disturbing over-the-top moments on wax that took place before Twitter’s 2006 launch.[apple_news_ad type="standard"]HipHopDX has compiled a list of 10 tracks that — had they been released today (assuming the same fan base/reach of each artist at the time) would warrant trending topics and endless thought pieces.</p>
<p>They dodged a bullet.Eminem - “Kim” (2000)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkgP54FuvIMFor obvious reasons, this domestic abuse nightmare didn’t have the cultural impact of a song like “Stan.” However, that does little to lessen the impact the song left on fans who all uttered a collective "WTF" the first time the standout from the GOAT rapper’s sophomore came on. Judging by the strong reaction Kamikaze caused, it’s safe to assume that Eminem stabbing his wife while screaming “bleed bitch bleed” would have caused Twitter pandemonium.Kool G Rap - “Great Train Robbery” (1992)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFF1Vuh7FY4There’s storytelling, and then there’s the gritty ability to paint a verbal picture that Kool G Rap has. “Great Train Robbery” was one of G Rap’s most ambitiously intense storylines.</p>
<p>From viciously sexually assaulting a woman at gunpoint on a train to shooting police, it’s easy to imagine social media bugging out — especially considering today’s climate. That’s not to say that this song would only be possible in the 90s because things were less “PC.” Warner Brothers refused to distribute the LP (Live and Let Die) because of its lyrical content and cover art.</p>
<p>Shocker.Akinyele - “I Luh Her” (1993)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FHJWmPIpcMBefore Akinyele dropped "Put It In Your Mouth," (which would be an excellent addition to this list), he released his debut album Vagina Diner via Interscope, scoring some light buzz. This song, in particular, didn't entirely raise as many eyebrows as it should have, but -- more or less -- he describes the desperate lengths he's contemplating to avoid becoming a father.</p>
<p>This includes straight up punching his hand through his girl's navel. Yikes.</p>
<p>We can only imagine the shock GIFs and emojis this song would have elicited.RZA f. ODB - “Black Widow Part 2” (2001)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG9Ulwv9TCYWe all love ODB.</p>
<p>We all love RZA. This song, however, is ridiculous.</p>
<p>From the inconsistency of walking down the street to suddenly being in a car to replying "bitch shut the fuck up" to a woman screaming "Dirt Dog I don't wanna die" during what doesn't feel like fully consensual sex, the entire record is beyond unnecessary. It's "Dog Shit" without any humor.</p>
<p>Twitter would have lost it.The Notorious B.I.G. - “Suicidal Thoughts” (1994)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GygEAcFFMVsIn a world where we are taking mental health more seriously than ever, this song comes off as revolutionary for its time. It's easy to assume there would have been a ton of timeline dialog around the fact that there is help out there.</p>
<p>It is probably the rawest Hip Hop example of checking on your strong friends. Puffy appears to be hearing all this for the first time (along with the listener) before Biggie ultimately takes his own life.Bushwick Bill - “Ever So Clear” (1992)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTn2fOAVHYMKeeping on the theme of mental health conversations, "Ever So Clear" stands as one of the wildest Hip Hop stories ever.</p>
<p>Geto Boy member Bushwick Bill breaks down the catalysts for his depression, which eventually leads to a disturbing encounter with a girlfriend where he threatens to drop a baby and finally gets his eye shot out. It's the clarity/peace he finds after surviving the brutal brush with death that many Twitter users stuck in their heads would likely find inspiring.Cam’ron - “Confessions” (1998)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0w2_BeZksgThis song has so many things in it that would light up Twitter timelines like a Christmas tree.</p>
<p>An incestuous relationship with his aunt, throwing a baby at a wall, having sex with a poodle, maybe having AIDS?!? Framed as a literal church confession (making it all the more WTF), it's odd that this song is rarely brought up.</p>
<p>Likely, it's because Cam buried this with so much content in the ensuing years.The Beatnuts - “Props Ova Here (Remix)” (1994)https://youtu.be/NGwE75sLE6o?t=119If the Rick Ross rape reference lost him a sneaker deal, we can only imagine the feedback that Beatnuts would have received in today times with Psycho Les' verse on this low-key remix of their first single, "Props Ova Here." Claiming to have stranded women on videotape trying to escape an abandoned house after you "bust nuts in their guts" could easily be triggering in the #MeToo era.LL Cool J - "How I'm Comin'" (1993)https://youtu.be/_F5E1uV-f14?t=159As one of the first prominent rappers ever, LL Cool J became a superstar by walking the fine line between this tough/street persona and perfect boyfriend material. That's what made this particular song off of his highly criticized 14 Shots To The Dome album so jarring.</p>
<p>Hearing LL say "Rockabye baby on the rooftop, open up your mouth and taste my Glock" and "Take off your clothes and taste my steel" is ... let's agree that he's lucky Twitter wasn't around.N.W.A- “One Less Bitch” (1991)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7dFWt9apQwWe saved this one for last because it's incredible that this song was allowed to be released. N.W.A was a game-changing group that pushed limits, and they deserve all the accolades they acquired.</p>
<p>However, this song wasn't witty, intelligent, or something Dr. Dre would want to hang his hat on in hindsight. He should be thankful that the Twitter generation didn't have to hear him preface a gang rape and murder of a prostitute with "So I had to kill her ... listen up to how I did it."[apple_news_ad type="standard"]​</p></div>
