  <h1>Comethazine Drops Dramatic Visual For A Cappella Single “Stand”</h1>
  <div class="meta">2019-07-19 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>After breaking into YouTube’s top trending charts, 21-year-old phenom Comethazine has blessed fans (and even more so producers) with his unorthodox new a cappella single/video “Stand.”Paired with a dramatic black-and-white treatment, the mildly subdued “Stand” is characterized by a haunting atmosphere.</p><p>He creates a truly hypnotic effect, harmonizing over his own trailing echoes.The single is the latest from Bawskee 3.5, which is the third installment of the series that began in 2017 and — officially — is being billed as his debut album.With well over 107 million combined streams on Spotify alone — and a gold certification for his single "Walk" (which sported an A$AP Rocky-featured remix) — it’s clear Comethazine is just getting started.Watch Comethazine’s ”Stand” above.</p></div>
