  <h1>Yellow Cloud & FHTMG Drop "IBFG" Visual</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>DMV camps Yellow Cloud (AAHH mainstays) and Forest Hills Tenleytown Music Group (FHTMG), have once again connected for their brand new banger, "IBFG," which they've dropped off with a dope new video that we've been bumping on repeat all day.

Over the bouncy instrumental with its lo-fi sample and booming bass, Treezus (of Yellow Cloud) and Abu Rahss trade some dope wordplay, and braggadocios Hip Hop shit!</p><p>The Treelag-produced visual treatment maintains an intriguing super eight camera aesthetic with its glitchy transitions and sporadic effects that almost feel like a malfunctioning security camera.</p><p>The Handycam aura gives it a really dope vibe.

"I been feeling good, I been feeling great," the chorus echoes before adding that they've been chilling and smoking backwoods.</p><p>The overall "living my best life" schtick is infectious; it creates an earworm that begs for playlist placement.</p><p>Check out the visual, above.</p></div>
