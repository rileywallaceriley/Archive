  <div class="content"><p>"There's no glory in keeping it real -- most people can't handle the truth." That's the type of gems you're going to get from London, UK, rapper Elijah Kaizen.</p><p>He's an artist's artist, who seems to exhibit the mindset that helped to build this culture initially -- and after you watch his mini video EPK, you'll understand what I mean by that.</p><p>What he lacks in flashy gimmicks, he more than makes up for with a refreshing dose of realistic insight and knowledge of self.</p><p>His recently released project, <a href="http://elijahkaizen.bandcamp.com/"><i>Cold Winter</i></a>, blends soulful beats with dope lyricism and is a must listen.</p><p>Hip-hop is truly universal; don't sleep on this heat from across the pond.</p><p>Give the project a spin, but first, check out the video below.</p></div>
