    <div class="meta">2018-09-30 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>First teased back in 2015 with the 9th Wonder produced track “We Must Stand,” famed Hip Hop wordsmiths — and notorious Polo rockers — Sadat X of Brand Nubian and El Da Sensei of The Artifacts have finally released their joint LP, XL.Sitting at 22 songs, the project features a small, incredibly curated list of guests including Nutso, R.A. The Rugged Man, Sa-Roc, A.G. and Freddie Foxxx a.k.a.</p>
<p>Bumpy Knuckles.Production is handled by J Rawls, DJ Spinna, Ment Plus, Internal Quest and more.“It took a minute to drop because both of us are busy men,” Sadat X tells HipHopDX about the album’s delay. “It took a second to get all the producers credits together.”El Da Sensei further elaborates, noting, “All the different producers, a couple of hard drive crashes here and there, a promise of an album mixed for the low never happened and way more beats than what was necessary [held us up].”El also adds they needed to secure a deal for the release. Settling on Germany-based indie imprint Vinyl Digital, the LP is available for streaming now and a limited run of 300 vinyl copies are on sale while supplies last.Check out Sadat X and El Da Sensei’s XL stream, cover art and tracklist below.1.</p>
