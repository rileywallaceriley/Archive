  <h1>Meek Mill Has Flex Apologize To “His Guy” Drake On Hot 97</h1>
  <div class="meta">2018-12-04 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>During a stop by Funkmaster Flex on Monday, December 3, Meek Mill put Flex on the spot after a brief discussion about his new album Championships.</p><p>While running down the LP’s features, Meek said: “Me and my man Drake good now, you going to stop getting at Drake?” What came next was an apology from the iconic New York City radio personality, who has remained one of Drake’s most vocal detractors.“If you're telling me to stop,” Flex began before Meek interjected with “One hundred percent ... we kickin’ it every day on the phone.</p><p>We ain’t just fake squash the beef.</p><p>He did what he needed to do.</p><p>He held it down.” As Meek explained, apologizing and being positive is the “new wave.”“Drake, I apologize,” said Flex — noting later in the interview that he’d be open to having an on-air conversation with Drizzy if Meek set it up.“I don't want it to be like a confusion,” Meek added.</p><p>That's my guy.  kicking it on every night, like ‘you fucked me up right there, you hit me hard, then you fucked me up right here.’ Like we point out confessions, letting niggas know.”“I'm going to follow your lead.</p><p>Me.</p><p>I'm gonna follow it,” Flex said.</p><p>It appears that — amongst the many negative examples abound — that Meek is using his platform, as someone who’s been there and done that, to put himself in an OG position.“I'm definitely leading the game right now with the youngins.   coach, trying to give them game and take them with me ... no pulling guns out.”Afterward, Meek dropped a freestyle over — of course — Drake’s “Back to Back.” Check out the full interview/freestyle above.</p></div>
