    <div class="content"><p>Bobby Hall -- better known as Logic -- is celebrating the release of his new novel Supermarket, which hit physical and digital shelves on Tuesday (March 26), with a complimentary soundtrack.“I wanted to use my novel as an opportunity to challenge myself musically diving into a completely new genre," Logic said via a press statement.Over the course of 13 songs, Logics sticks to his strengths in doses but takes a crack at an alt-rock, guitar-driven sound.https://open.spotify.com/album/7C5J8fG34IbOKe2pQPq9SUThe novel -- published by Simon & Schuster -- is a dark thriller that echoes the work of Quentin Tarantino, Chuck Palahniuk and Kurt Vonnegut. It follows Flynn, the protagonist, as he discovers that his newfound muse (in the form of a job at a supermarket) isn't what it appeared to be after arriving to work one day to find a crime scene.Next up for Logic is his new album Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind, which he dropped the title track for last week.</p>
