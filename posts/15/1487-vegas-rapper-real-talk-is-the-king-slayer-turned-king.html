  <h1>Vegas Rapper Real Talk Is “The King Slayer Turned King”</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sat, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>The best part about being a writer is discovering dope new music; this week I was put on to an artist who—though far from new—was new to my radar.</p><p>Chicago-born Real Talk The Metaphor Messiah, currently living in Vegas, dropped a new project entitled <em>King Slayer Turned King</em>, and I’m here for it!</p><p>At seven songs in length, the record feels kind of like tuning into season six of an HBO series and hoping to catch on.</p><p>Not that you get lost—as there isn’t any continuity-based conceptual songwriting happening.</p><p>Instead, he is exceptionally polished, lending to the fact that this isn’t his first project, and much of the non-rapping dialogue focuses on his legacy.</p><p>I did some digging around before giving the LP a third spin; he has a lot of great material in his catalog; what stands out is his diversity, traversing empowering content, social commentary, and good old fashioned bars.</p><p>It doesn’t necessarily subscribe to a particular lane, so I’m having a difficult time making specific comparisons, but check out these records for a great idea of what he’s on.

<blockquote>“A lot of artists come out and only talk about one thing ... and that one thing isn’t something they live.”
—Real Talk</blockquote>
Now, a few facts that will add context to his new project.</p><p>First is his relationship with producer Geesus. “ about ten years ... he's been doing my beats for a long time, and he's my best friend,” he tells AAHH.</p><p>This is vital, as he produces most of the LP, and he also has an interlude.</p><p>The second fact, back in 2016 he lost his eyesight for about seven months—something he overcame after having surgery to reattach his retinas.</p><p>It’s something that comes up quite a bit on the project and isn’t just a metaphor...it’s a literal reference to an experience that profoundly changed his outlook.

“God MC’s don’t die,” he states on the outro of the opening track, “Hip Hop Is Mine.” The record has a serious bop—and Real Talk is in his pocket off the rip.</p><p>His bars and delivery are on point. “Niggas all fake fucking You-Tube rappers,” he raps. 

“War Games” is another standout.</p><p>With a super interesting instrumental—the sample almost has a regal feel to it.

“Baal” is a dope track; Real Talk has a 90s Hip Hop influence—and this instrumental and flow highlight that.</p><p>This one was (according to what I’ve been able to ascertain) was the first track he laid down following his Euro tour.</p><p>He gave this one a visual treatment, check that out below.

Look, at seven tracks (a few of which are interludes) it’s a light listen that begs for a few complete run throughs.</p><p>His catalog of visuals are impressive; not only is quality there, but the plays are crazy.</p><p>Also—again—he’s touring and making noise.</p><p>As the project ends with the piano-driven title track, he solidifies himself as a voice that will lead us to the “truth.” Whether or not you honestly believe that, he’ll point you in a different, more positive direction than plenty of records forced into your personal space.</p><p>Give it a spin.
