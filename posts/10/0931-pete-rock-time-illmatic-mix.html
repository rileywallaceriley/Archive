  <h1>Pete Rock "Time Is Illmatic" Mix</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><p class="p1">Nas's Classic debut <a href=" is timeless – period.</p><p>It's something that has been written about and debated to death; however, with the recent release of the documentary <a href=" Is Illmatic</em></a>, we are reminded of the bigger picture the album represents.</p><p>It's more than just Nas – although he is a big part of it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p class="p1">The album represents the time in history, the goldenera of modern culture of hip-hop, the upper-echelon of respected hip-hop production and the sheer unadulterated, unmanufactured <em>love</em> of the artform – it's quite the story.</p><p>This album is the purest representation of what hip-hop is, and <em>should</em> be.</p><p>Even though everyone involved in this project has gone on to make amazing things – i.e <a href=" <a href=" Pro</a>, <a href=" Rock</a> and <a href=" this almost still reads as an opus in many respects.</p>

<p class="p1">To support the release of the documentary Pete Rock released an official <a href=" Is Illmatic</a> mix on SoundCloud.</p><p>Definitely worth a spin.</p><p>If you haven't seen the movie, do so immediately.</p>
