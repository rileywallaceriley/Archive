    <h1>Dax Drops Bloody “Dear God” Visual</h1>
    <div class="meta">2019-10-12 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Following a rollout that began on September 29, and culminated in a new Tattoo reveal on October 5, Canadian MC Dax released his brand new single and provocative visual “Dear God” on October 10 — a song he hopes will promote healthy dialogue about religion.The track, as he explains, is simply unanswered questions — and in no way an attempt to turn atheists into believers (à la Kanye West’s “Jesus Walks”).“As I grew older I drifted away [from church] because I think I was never properly explained why I should be there,” he wrote via Instagram.“I’ve had this ‘Dear God’ idea for a while but could never finish writing it because I didn’t feel I had enough life experiences,” he adds. “Now at 25 I feel ‘somewhat’ ready.”From beef with Tory Lanez to viral singles and a two-month tour with rapper Tech Nine, Dax is having quite an eventful year. Currently, he’s set to cap off 2019 with his first 23-date headlining tour, kicking-off Friday (October 18) in San Antonio, Texas.Largely, he managed to keep the same energy he had in his interview with HipHopDX in January of 2019 — and cross a large number items off of the list of goals he made public on his social media.Though his EP Fuck Love has yet to materialize, he’s maintained a steady momentum.Stream the visual for Dax’s “Dear God” above.</p></div>
