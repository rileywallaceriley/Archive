<p>Cole's debut album Cole World: A Sideline Story appears to have disappeared from all streaming networks. The revelation was made via social media, causing confusion from fans accustomed to perusing his catalog freely.Dreamville President Ibrahim Hamad responded to the many tweets floated his way noting, "I’m aware of what happened and we will get it back up soon ... You can stop tweeting me now."It's unclear exactly why the album was taken down and when it will return.</p>
<p>Dreamville is obviously aware of the situation, but it's also missing from the label's official website. The bulk of his discography -- including his highly acclaimed pre-Cole World mixtapes The Warm Up and Friday Night Lights -- remain though.[apple_news_ad type="any"]</p></div>
