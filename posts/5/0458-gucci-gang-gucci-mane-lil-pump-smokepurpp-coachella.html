  <h1>Gucci Gang: Gucci Mane, Lil Pump SmokePurpp Assemble Rap’s Newest Supergroup</h1>
  <div class="meta">2019-01-04 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>While many concert goers and fans initially lampooned The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival for what appeared to be an obvious typo — listing Gucci Mane as Gucci Gang — a rep reached out to TMZ on Thursday (January 3) to confirm that no mistake was made.</p><p>Gucci Gang is actually a new group, comprised of Gucci Mane, Lil Pump, and Smokepurpp.Though the name is actually kind of clever, fans seem to be split on the idea of the group — mostly because it’s still not clear exactly what it is, or what to expect.Lil Pump did get down with Guwop’s 1017 Eskimo Records roster following a bidding war in early 2018, so perhaps this collaboration has been a long time coming.</p><p>In fact, it’s not really that surprising, especially after Pump and Gucci recently performed together to open the 2018 BET Awards. https://youtu.be/QedsJ65aGKUNobody outside of Purpp is running with the announcement via social media though, and there is no official confirmation that this anything more than a one-time thing.</p><p>However, there are over three months until Coachella, so it’s not unbelievable to think that we’ll see a project before then.</p></div>
