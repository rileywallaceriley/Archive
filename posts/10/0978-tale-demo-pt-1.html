  <h1>Tale Of The Demo Pt. 1</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>When I was a kid rappers had demo tapes – and I'm not talking about mp3s or even cds.</p><p>I'm talking actual cassette tapes.</p><p>During the golden era of hip-hop, you either had access to a proper studio, or you recorded demo tapes in your closet.</p><p>Either way, when played today, classic demo tapes provide an authentic sound and feel that is hard to replicate by digital means.</p><p>Over the next few weeks we'll be exploring some of the dopest demos we've come across – from unreleased b-sides, original versions of classics to reference tracks and unearthed gems.</p><p>Hold on to your hats kiddies, we're about to do some digging.

<strong>A Tribe Called Quest</strong>

As pivotal members of the Native Tongues, and early affiliates of the Jungle Brothers, the squad, consisting of Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, Jerobe and Ali Shaheed Muhammed ushered in the jazzy sound that purists still run with today.</p><p>If you haven't watched their movie, <a href=" so immediately</a>.</p><p>Anyways, the demo below is a collection of snippets off their original demo tape – and it's glorious.</p><p>It includes demos of classics like <em>Description of a Fool</em>, <em>Left My Wallet In El Segundo</em> and an unreleased track that we've never heard before.

<strong>Wu-Tang Clan</strong>

Wu-Tang is pretty much the most successful group of its kind – and they have the discography to prove it.</p><p>Below is a copy of their original 1992 demo tape, which I'll disclaimer <em>may</em> only appeal to the real heads.</p><p>If that sounds like you, this 28 demo is a treasure cove of amazing shit – from the demo version of <em>Tearz</em> to an alternate version of <em>Bring The Ruckus</em>.</p><p>It also has some shit we hadn't heard before.</p><p>Worth a listen for any fan of the clan.

<strong>DMX</strong>

This one is interesting; it's a relic from the period in between early 90's <em>Born Loser</em> DMX, who was kind of <em>meh</em>, and the 1996 <em>It's Dark And Hell Is Hot</em> X, who we actually wish we could have back!</p><p>DMX has definitely gone through his share of ups and pretty embarrassing downs, but it's impossible to deny how much we all enjoyed listening to his old shit.</p><p>This is a joint that, from what we know, was recorded in '95 – and it holds up.</p><p>Worth a spin.

<strong>Kanye West</strong>

In his own words, Kanye West is the most inspirational artist of our generation.</p><p>Whether or not you agree, it's impossible to argue his success.</p><p>He's definitely blessed us with a discography of songs (and beats) that make for a strong case.</p><p>We've all heard the stories of how he was a rapper all along, and after much grinding, Dame Dash finally heard him out – and the rest is history.</p><p>This, from what we can figure, is the tape that he played for Dame and Jigga.</p><p>He's far from transforming to full <em>Yeezus</em> yet at this point, but he still had bars and beats.</p><p>Give it an ear.
