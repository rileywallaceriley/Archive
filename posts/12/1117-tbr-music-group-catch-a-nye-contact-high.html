  <h1>TBR Music Group: Catch A NYE Contact High</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Hailing from Houston, Texas – home of legendary crews like UGK, and the infamous Screwed Up Click – comes <a href="http://www.tbrmusic.com/">TBR Music Group</a> a collective featuring rap duo Chain$moke (Mikey O.D. &amp; Kelly Indica) and solo rap artist Spayc3.</p><p>Although all three of the artists within this music collective have unique personalities and approaches, they all share an immense love for psychoactive substances.</p><p>In fact, they have it listed as a musical influence, leading the collective to develop a dark, expressive and laid back sound.</p><p>This sound can be heard throughout their new EP, <em><a href="http://www.tbrmusic.com/#!contact-high/lv2n0">Contact High</a></em>, which is due to drop New Year’s Eve – great news for y’all smokers out there.</p><p>The EP, which sits at a mere five tracks, gives a great introduction to the trio, who bob and weave over bassy, trunk rattling production.</p><p>It’s the sound, quite frankly, I've come to expect from Texas (not a bad thing).</p><p>True to their mantra, they don’t stray too far from hazy rhymes that are so potent, you’d think you could smell the OG Kush through the speakers.</p><p>The guys shine especially hard over the dark production in <em>Colorado</em>, which sounds like an audio road trip to the state that grossed so much money after legalizing marijuana, they’re developing ways to give some of it back.</p><p>It's their modern-day mecca.</p><p>My fave joint here is the slightly more uptempo/bouncy <em>Set The Record</em>, where they explain: "<em>Don’t keep many friends because they all become enemies in the end.</em>” It’s all about crew love.</p><p>I’d love to see them try some slightly different production, just to hear how their chemistry, which they’ve seemed to perfect on this EP, reacts. <a href="http://www.tbrmusic.com/">TBR Music Group</a> are relative newcomers, but their careers go back quite a long way; and even before joining forces, each member of the group boasted an impressive background.</p><p>When asked about working as solo artists, the crew explains, "<em>when musicians join forces for the sake of producing great, uncompromising work, anything can happen.</em>”
