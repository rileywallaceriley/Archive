<b>How did you get involved in hip-hop?</b>

Believe it or not, the first hip-hop song I ever heard came from Bow Wow.</p><p>I just remember getting ready for school and the song played on the TV.</p><p>I was probably like 5, and I was only used to soca that my parents played around in the house or Michael Jackson, who was my favorite artist at the time.</p><p>Ever since that day, I followed hip hop closely.</p><p>Starting off with Bow Wow and my love elevated even more after 50 Cent debuted.</p><p>I was about nine at that time.</p><p>He made me love the art of hip-hop.

<b>Who were some of your influences?</b>

I'm influenced by just about everything.</p><p>Growing up my biggest influences were 50 Cent and Kanye West even though my style was pretty different from both.</p><p>These days, I got a lot of Young Thug in my playlist along with plenty other of these young artists out here.</p><p>I just gain influence from everyone or personal experiences.</p><p>I might like the way a certain Lupe Fiasco beat sound along with the cadences of a Lil Durk hook.</p><p>I listen to just about everyone’s music which in turn just betters the product I’m trying to put out.

<b>Tell me about your music – what are you currently working on?</b>

I’m still working on my first EP, “Skinny Dippin’ With Naked B*tches in Poland”.</p><p>I have a video that I recently recorded that's supposed to drop next week called “Potent” featuring my boy Ravage Roc.</p><p>I got a lot in store.</p><p>I’ve been writing every day.</p><p>A lot of work in the arsenal.</p><p>I’d love to release a new video every month.</p><p>So we’ll see what happens.

<b>How would you describe your sound?</b>

My sound is refreshing, harmonic, melodic, emotional, ravishing and raw.</p><p>I might be one of the few young guys that can put a hook together but also keep it “lyrical”.</p><p>I try to cater to both sides of hip hop fans.</p><p>The ones that like to sing along to the hooks and the fans that decipher each and every word in the verse.</p><p>Songs that could be played on the radio and in the club but also could be played when your alone and going thru it or just bumping. 

<b>What are your goals in the industry?</b>

I don’t think I would want to be an artist forever.</p><p>Probably have a good successful little run as an artist.</p><p>In the latter years, I want to move around behind the scenes.</p><p>Work with other artists songwriting, producing and all the other good stuff.</p><p>Hopefully by my 40s, I could lead a successful entertainment company.

<b>What do you want people to take away from you as an artist?</b>

The works of a creative genius.</p><p>I put a lot of work into my music and videos.</p><p>Obviously, my budget isn’t huge for my whole idea to be put on a platter, but when I reach that platform appreciate my creativity and uniqueness.</p><p>There’s not another Jimmy Heights. 

<b>Do you want to remain independent or sign to a major label?</b>

Of course, I’d love to stay independent.</p><p>With the way that the music industry is moving with all resources available to unsigned artists, it makes sense to stay independent.</p><p>But if the right deal comes along that could set my family for life, it would be stupid and selfish to pass up on it.</p></div>
