<strong>How did you get into hip-hop?
</strong>
Well, I got into the it watching my older brother (Un Pacino) who was doing his rap thing, so being around him in the studio, and being in school battling people.</p><p>That's what molded me.</p><p>I was always into rapping, but it wasn't until I started to get exposed to big names in the studio with my brother – like Prodigy and Juelz Santana – that I actually began to take it seriously.

<strong>How did you connect with P initially?</strong>

Well, as I mentioned, my brother Un worked with Prodigy .</p><p>He released an album with him a few years ago (<em><a href=" Of The 80's</a></em>).</p><p>So I was always around the studio during that time.</p><p>Prodigy took a liking to me – I was a skateboarder, and he could see that I had a certain swag about me.</p><p>He could see I wasn't like all these other dudes spitting.</p><p>I had bars.</p><p>So he started rapping with me.</p><p>We’ve been collaborating ever since.

<strong>Let's talk about this latest project "<em>Young Rollin' Stonerz</em>" – what was the process of putting this album together?</strong>

We wanted to make a record that listeners could ride out to.</p><p>Something to uplift.</p><p>We wanted it to be an extremely laid back vibe – you know smoke a blunt, drink some champagne and zone out to the music.</p><p>Classy, classic music.

<strong>What was the recording process?</strong>

All the records we did, we did in the studio together.</p><p>We would just go through beats – he'd bring beats to the table, and I'd bring some to the table.</p><p>From there we'd just lay down tracks.

<strong>Do you guys have lots of stash tracks?</strong>

Yeah, we got a lot of stash tracks .

<strong>Well, the album is dope...</strong>

What was your fave track?

<strong>Personally?</p><p>I like <em>Pass Me</em>.</strong>

That track almost didn't make it on the album.</p><p>Prodigy wasn't feeling it that much; he didn't like the hook I'd done.</p><p>He wanted to keep a street feel and thought the song was a little outside of the vibe he was going for.</p><p>I liked it – it has a commercial sound.</p><p>It sounds like a song about a girl, but it's a song about life.</p><p>P eventually agreed and let me put it on there.

<strong>Did you guys have any other disagreements about what songs to include?</strong>

We had a few, but that's only natural.</p><p>We both want the best product possible.

<strong>I also really love <em>40oz</em>.</strong>

Oh, <em>40oz</em> is joint!</p><p>That joint was originally supposed to be me and Chinx Drugz, but we ended up using it for this project

<strong>Are you guys going to tour the album at all?</strong>

We're currently doing one now – it's the Infamous tour, though.</p><p>We're supposed to have our tour around January I think

<strong>Do you have any other projects out right now?</strong>

Yeah, my latests projects <em><a href="http://www.datpiff.com/Boogz-Boogetz-COOL-Creating-Our-Own-Lane-mixtape.380336.html">Cool</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.datpiff.com/Boogz-Boogetz-American-Fly-mixtape.510335.html">American Fly</a></em> are available now, and I have <em>Cool 2</em> coming soon – that project has names like Fat Trel, Smoke Dza and Vado on it (to name a few).

<strong>Any last words? </strong>

Look out for the whole YR roster, look out for the entire Infamous Records, shout out my homie Swag and my crew up in Canada.</p><p>The entire gang man, we here – zoning!
