<p>Following up on the singles "No Favors" and "Fallback," 22-year-old East Brunswick, New Jersey rapper, and producer Doov drops his latest single, "On The Gram." The premise is straight forward, with Doov professing love for a girl he's infatuated with on the popular social network Instagram — crooning melodic bars over an absolutely hypnotic beat built for multiple spins.</p>

<p>Doov picked up quite a bit of buzz last year with his self-produced coming-of-age LP <em>Separation</em>, which impressively topped over 300k total plays in its first two months.</p><p>Though he's still relatively fresh in the game, there is an unmistakable sense of confidence about his sound, which is exhilarating.</p><p>It's not necessarily that his music is abundantly different in its aesthetic, but Doov himself has a presence that sets him apart.<br>​<br>Plus, he's stage-ready, having opened up high profile gigs for the late Pop Smoke, G Herbo, and 100 gecs — as well as headlined shows throughout New York City.</p>
