What were you doing on the 10th anniversary of Kanye's <em>College Dropout</em>?</p><p>I was busy <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/the-college-dropout-11-years-later/">writing about</a> it – naturally.</p><p>Spencer Waddell though, better known by his "stage name" Tooty, was busy uploading his debut mixtape, <em>First Degree Murder</em>.</p><p>Unfortunately, with a name like that, and the current temperament of the "Chiraq" eco-sphere, I wasn't quite sure whether or not I was walking into a project that treaded more into the Chief Keef side of things.</p><p>Lucky for me, Tooty's project follows in the footsteps of some of the more pivotal Chi-Town hip-hop "institutions".

<em>First Degree Murder</em> is an exciting blend of sounds, emotions and Midwest charm.</p><p>It paints a portrait of a dream chaser, lady killer  and a street smart young man who's managed to overcome the negativity engulfing the city of Chicago.</p><p>The first track I was drawn to was <em>Life Ain't What It Seem</em>, featuring <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/xvrhldy-new-sound-chi-town/">XVRHLDY</a>.</p><p>If you're an AAHIPHOP reader, you know we're <strong>big</strong> fans of his – and this song definitely didn't disappoint.</p><p>I then rounded back to the top and ran through the 15 joint project head to toe.

–Tooty</blockquote>

The project, overall, is quite honest and dripping with real life experience – no over the top embellishing here.</p><p>On songs like <em>I Don't Need A Hook</em>, and the super dope <em>Dear Diary</em>, he discusses topics such as loss, drive and determination, while he gets silky on bassy joints like <em>On Repeat</em> and the LL Cool J sampled <em>Super Fly</em>.</p><p>The latter reminded me of the song <em><a href=" by Camp-Lo.</p><p>Standouts for me were the super laid-back <em>To Whom It May Concern</em>, the obligatory ode to the culture, <em>Hip-Hop</em>, and the super creative TLC flip, <em>Creep</em>.</p><p>First impressions aren't always fair – as a writer, I'm reminded of that everyday.</p><p>The (now seemingly clever) title and cover of this project had me judging Tooty before I pressed play.</p><p>Now, 15 joints later, I've placed him on my mind's shelf next to other bright stars hailing from the Windy City.</p><p>Even the title track itself, <em>First Degree Murder</em> was super laid back, and surprisingly bar heavy; a far cry from the braggadocios/salacious gun talk I was expecting.</p><p>Tooty is currently putting the finishing touches on his follow-up, <em>Suicidal Thoughts</em>.</p><p>Now, this is the third time this week I've professed my love of single producer albums, but – shit – I <em>love</em> them.</p><p>Tooty is going that route, working entirely with producer Von Vuai, and guests including XVRHLDY.</p><p>We'll definitely be checking for it!</p><p>Below is the first single from the project.
