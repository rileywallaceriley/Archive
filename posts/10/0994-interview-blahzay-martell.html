<strong>Introduce yourself to our readers.</strong>

Blahz Martell of Blahzay Blahzay.

<strong>How did you get involved in hip-hop?</strong>

My older brother and sister was into Hiphop..sheepskins and rope chains and my father made gospel music.

<strong>Who were some of your influences coming up in the game?</strong>

There where a lot of artists that influenced me growing up.</p><p>All of that music from the late 80's early 90's.</p><p>My problem was, when you meet the artist your perspective change a lot and I met a lot of artists growing up in Brooklyn.</p><p>But Guru and Premo of GANGSTARR became real unique in my influences, because they were exactly the same people in real life they were on their records.

<strong>Talk about the breakout hit Danger.</strong>

Everybody in NYC was popping off at the time except EAST NEW YORK, so we was trying to make a anthem for our hood.

<strong>Did you know that it would be a hit?</strong>

I knew everybody around my way would love it, but not so many people around the world.

<strong>Was it your favourite track on "Blah Blah Blah"?</p><p>If not, what was?</strong>

My favorite is <em><a href=" COP BAD COP</a></em> because of the story.</p><p>I think everybody loves a good story.

<strong>Can you share any of your most memorable moments from that period in your career?</strong>

Performing and getting love in places in Europe where people never met black people or even Americans.

<strong>Can you tell us about your relationship with Notorious B.I.G?</strong>

We was both managed by Dj Mister Cee, and was a part of that original entourage that travelled with Big, breaking his music.

<strong>There was never an official 2nd (album) release for Blahzay Blahzay – can you share why not?</strong>

One of the major reasons was the record industry flip flopping on us after Biggie and Tupac was murdered.</p><p>Everyone ran far away from the East Coast vs West Coast campaign .The record that brought us to international recognition was later getting me black balled and Mercury closed their black music department.

<strong>What are some of things (musically) you've worked on since that period?</strong>

Hellz yeah a lot of music, but one of the biggest things I'm proud of is being a part of bringing Hip Hop to the East again, Far East, to Thailand with the hip hop group THAITANIUM.

<strong>Do you still work with PF?</strong>

Oh yeah he's a major part of the present production in a lot of different ways .</p><p>In the past he did exclusive production now he's giving his golden ear to a lot of younger producers.

<strong>Tell us about your podcast "<a href=" The Blah Blah Blah</a>"?</strong>

Im sitting down with some of the hottest recording artists and comedians for a round table discussion about everything relevant today.

<strong>What are you currently working on?</strong>

My new album.

<strong>What are your thoughts on the current state of NYC hip-hop?</strong>

It's going in a great direction and I really respect a lot of the new artists that was able to be successful in a era that had no CDs and vinyl.

<strong>What are your top 3 albums ever?</strong>

I can't race them like horses, there are too many that hold a special place.

<strong>What keeps you motivated to continue making music?</strong>

I like to say music is in me not on me and if you really listen to my first album you would know them kids will be doing music forever.

<strong>Tell us about your latest song/video.</strong>

Wake up / No Sleeping, the name says it all.</p><p>Reflecting on how we, as a society, are nothing but sheeples being led to slaughter.

<strong>Any last words for our readers?</strong>

Don't be a SHEEPLES!</p><p>Keep supporting that <em>above average hip hop</em>.
