  <h1>#IndieSpotlight: Shay Lamai Pays Tribute To New York City</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><blockquote>"You know what time it is, you can tell it from the shoe style."</blockquote>
Tampa, Florida, based rapper who was raised in the Mecca, Shay Lamai, has music in his DNA.</p><p>With members on both sides of his family having had some success in the industry, his path has been carved out.</p><p>He's aiming to distance himself from the sea of trap and mumble rappers in favour of a more contemporary take on the classic New York sound.

"I Love New York," is a well-crafted tribute to the city he grew up in, with a jazzy baseline that takes a note from classic Q-Tip production.</p><p>Shay is determined to breakthrough and make his place in hiphop; give his latest a spin, and if you're feeling it mash the share button.
