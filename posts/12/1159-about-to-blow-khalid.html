  <div class="content"><p><a href=" http://pigeonsandplanes.com/2015/11/indify-next-artist-social-media/s/kai/">Pigeon's And Planes</a> recently ran a piece – in conjunction with Indify – that identified artists with strong social followings, who were poised for greatness.</p><p>The list included names like Toronto's best-kept-secret Jazz Cartier and Nas' protégé, Dave East.</p><p>A name that definitely stands out, though, is 18-year-old Texas-native, Khalid!.</p><p>Listening to his Soundcloud, it's hard to fathom that he's only been making music for four months.</p><p>After hearing an acoustic song of his on Soundcloud, his current management started flying him out to different studios to help find a sound, make some tracks, and figure everything out.</p><p>Currently, Khalid! has production from the likes of Syk Sense (<i><a href=" Yourself</a> </i>&amp; <i><a href=" God</a></i> by Drake // <i><a href=" &amp; <i><a href=" Em Know</a></i> by Bryson Tiller) &amp; OZ (Travis Scott, Chris Brown, Big Sean, DJ Khaled) and a few others.</p><p>He's currently in the studio developing a collection of music; but, he's still keeping his Soundcloud fresh.</p><p>Take a listen (above) to his latest track, <i>Reasons</i>, which already has ridiculous organic buzz.</p><p>Keep on eye on this kid!</p><p>Social media:
