<p>Anyone who knows me knows I'm a sucker for lo-fi instrumental albums.</p><p>At the same time, I love working with music, especially throughout the process of my new book, but as a hardcore listener, I find it's distracting to refrain from analyzing the bars as I hear them.</p><p>So instrumental albums are my ace.</p><p>A recent LP I was wearing out was Max I Million's <em><a href="https://www.fatbeats.com/products/max-i-million-uncut-gems-lp-blue-w-white-splatter-vinyl">Uncut Gems</a></em> that I received in a care package from the good homies at Coalmine Records.</p>

<p>But the last few weeks have been harder on my brain than usual, and London-based producer, Big O, has a new LP (<em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/37RREfmcPsg9wTv5WogzIY">The Mind's Mirror</a></em>) that has been such a refreshing, creative soundtrack to my movements. </p>

<p>The project at 20 joints, chopped and sizzled to perfection with a healthy variety of vibes and admirably one-point sequencing. </p>

<p>It's interesting how it starts as a premium lo-fi Spotify playlist, with the opener "Unfulfilled Desires" and the follow-up "Imagined Scenario," which are hot but sport a noticeably familiar sonic aesthetic that had me feeling quite comfortable.</p><p>BUT, when that Dilla-esque soul flip at the end of the latter track came on, I knew this was special.</p><p>Things speed up and slow down at will, floating you above a sonic tapestry woven with tons of really creative little clips.</p>

<p>A good example is a skit on "Don't Heckle Me," with a gentleman cussing out a heckler, which leads the transition into the soulful second half.</p>

<p>There are some highlights for me; I played a lot of "Visionary Fantasy" featuring Melvin Toussaint &amp; Onisor Rodila, with the delicious vibed-out guitar, oh man.</p><p>The saxophone on "<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://big-o.bandcamp.com/track/everlasting-time-feat-cancori">Everlasting Time" with CanCori</a> was also something I ran back a few times.</p><p>Then there was "<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://big-o.bandcamp.com/track/watchujuannado-feat-abel-boquera-2">WatchuJuannaDo" featuring Abel Boquera</a>, which sounds like a neo-soul love child of MF DOOM's "Gas Drawls" and R.Kelly's "Step In The Name Of Love," to me anyway .</p>

<p>It's one of those projects that I'd be happy to learn is connected to other projects; after a few listens, I could almost hear rappers on these beats, especially with this many flavors.</p><p>I could see someone in Griselda's vein, like Boldy James, eating on "Mind Glitch," for example.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instrumental albums aren't an easy feat; without the songs themselves, the producer is left to sequence by vibes, which is a delicate balance.</p><p>Too much in one direction or the other can make a project bland, or ho-hum and forgettable in a dose too small.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Big O manages to walk the line, with enough going on to keep you engaged all the way through.</p><p>It has an almost sunny, West Coast disposition about it.</p><p>Crate diggers and lo-fi junkies will find a lot to love here.</p>
