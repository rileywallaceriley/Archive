    <div class="content"><p>Timelines have already been buzzing about the influence of Valee's flow, and now, Trippie Redd is calling the 29-year-old up-and-comer one of the GOATs for having his style copied by so many artists.“I see everybody biting your sound ... how does it feel?” Trippie Redd asked with a smile in a recent Instagram Story. “I should feel amazing because you’re a fucking GOAT. Welcome to the game.”A recent video by Genius illustrates the stark similarities in some of the alleged re-workings of the G.O.O.D.</p>

Without being specific, he tweeted this past June, “About to start selling this sauce since everybody wanna take it.”And Valee's response to Trippie's compliment?</p>
