--EJ Carter</blockquote>
Godfather of the Panic Flow, leader of the R$F Regime , rapper, singer, producer, engineer, videographer and photographer, EJ Carter is a rising star in the game.</p><p>Born in St.</p><p>Louis, Missouri, he self-describes as different and unpredictable – two adjectives that are entirely accurate, especially after we took a watch/listen to his new single and video, “True.”

Stylistically, EJ is a strange brew – that is for sure.</p><p>He sounds like a blend on B.O.B and Flo Rida  and has a physical look/style that comes off as a thematic mix of Lil’ Yachty, Andre 3000, and more.</p><p>To explain, he delivers a catchy, singsong chorus that gets  into your cranium, and parks there for a few days.</p><p>The verses themselves, though, are more complicated.</p><p>It’s a fresh experience.</p><p>The video itself start off with a definition of being, true.</p><p>This seems to suggest that a good portion of the threats/claims you may hear are in fact real talk, and should be heeded accordingly.</p><p>Leading up to his  debut album <em>Notorious</em>, EJ built a name and following with his  crew, releasing two mixtapes that generated over 10K downloads each .</p><p>He also developed a live show that led to him opening for up for fast-rap legend Twista, Snow Tha Product, Caskey, and Shady Records signee, Yelawolf.</p><p>In a sea of mediocracy and an overabundance of clones, EJ Carter stands out.</p><p>Cor what’s next!</p><p>Check out his dope new record, and stay tuned for what’s next!</p><p>Download on iTunes: http://smarturl.it/EJCNotorious
