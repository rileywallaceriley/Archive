<strong>How did you guys get together as a group?
</strong>
Sully: We were friends years before we ever started recording together.</p><p>Dee had already had a mixtape out called dreams and nightmares way before Meek Mill ever came up with it.</p><p>We were at my house one night and talking about music; I showed him some of the stuff I had recorded when I started recording a few years ago and then it was like instant working chemistry. 

<strong>Tell me about<em> The Quickfix Mixtape</em>.</p><p>Are you guys also working on solo projects?</strong>

Sully: <em>The Quickfix Mixtape</em> is a short collection of songs 5-7 from us that gives a taste of what we're doing while we are working on our solo projects.</p><p>It's usually just composed of songs we wrote and had fun with, like when you hear something that you know you should have another rapper on, I immediately call Dee and that's another one for the Quickfix.</p><p>Ddaboi: <em>The Quickfix Mixtape</em> is a series that we're working on consistently.</p><p>It's a unique yet addictive sound it's giving you the feeling of something new but something you want to hear again, something that you crave, kind of like a drug, that's why we call it the <em>Quickfix</em>.</p><p>Sully: We are both working on solo projects.</p><p>Mine is going to be called <em>Silver Lining</em> which might end up a working title.</p><p>I
want it to be a mixture of sounds and jazz and soul influences like "section 80" and "acid rap".</p><p>Ddaboi: My project is called <em>The Event</em>.</p><p>It's based on life experience I've been through, kind of like a story.</p><p>Similar to how The Weeknd vibes on his projects, It'll be a combination of R&amp;B and rap. 
<strong>
What are you guys working on next?</strong>

Ddaboi: <em>Quickfix Volume 2</em>! (Laughs)

Sully: Pretty much.</p><p>It's Vol. 2 first because we're getting a real push for it, especially on SoundCloud.</p><p>We've had songs on the radio, been added to artist rosters; we haven't "blown up" yet -- but we damn sure have opened some doors, but Vol.2 is going to knock the whole wall down. 

<strong>What are your goals in this industry?
</strong>
Sully: I just want to be big enough that I can do this for a living.</p><p>That I can take a hobby that I enjoy and put energy Into and it becomes who I am instead of something I do.</p><p>That would be an ideal life for me.</p><p>Ddaboi: My goal is to get signed to a good label that I can depend on that will put out my album instead of constant delays.</p><p>Earn a lot of fans. 
<strong>
What do you want people to take away from you as artists?</strong>

Ddaboi: That I'm going to be one of the greatest inspirations in music, and you're watching me on the come-up.</p><p>This is the moment before it happens.</p><p>Sully: I want them to see that we're young with almost no resources and we're already making moves.</p><p>Like from where I'm from you can't do this type of stuff.</p><p>Sully: They don't allow this kind of shit, nobody wants you to be successful; but, only the actual artists get that.</p><p>We're doing it for everybody, if one of us makes it, there's a chance a lot more people can make it.</p><p>Because musically, it feels like a wasteland here sometimes, but it's just starting to bubble for us, and it's happening.</p><p>Ddaboi: We're young, but it already feels like we have enough talent to push up into the big leagues, it just takes one good chance.</p><p>This is just the first tape, imagine how much we're going to progress on to the next. 
<strong>
Are you guys looking to get signed -- or stay indie?</strong>

Ddaboi: I'm not looking for just a deal, I'm looking for the right deal.</p><p>Sully: Only if it's right.</p><p>So many artists get shit deals, yes they're okay, they got money, and they got, at least, top 10 hit, but it limits their creative freedom and growth.</p><p>I'd like some freedom when it comes to my music.</p><p>I don't mind a slight push in a particular direction, but I'd like to do my own thing as well or what's the point?</p></div>
