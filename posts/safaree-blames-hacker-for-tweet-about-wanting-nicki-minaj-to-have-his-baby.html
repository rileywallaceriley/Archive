    <h1>Safaree Blames Hacker For Tweet About Wanting Nicki Minaj To Have His Baby</h1>
    <div class="meta">2017-07-28 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>It's one thing to be in a relationship with someone for 12 years before going in separate directions — it's a whole other situation when your ex is a superstar, and you're bombarded with unavoidable details about her new life. Such is the case for Safaree Samuels, who was the one-time better-half to Queens rapper Nicki Minaj.Thursday night, it appeared that Safaree was far from over Nicki, as he noted that the rap-pop star should, in fact, be having his baby in a now-deleted tweet.The message came a few weeks after a tweet made by Nicki that set off pregnancy speculation.But now Safaree is denying that he had anything to do with the post.If you thought the internet would be sympathetic to Safaree, who has had a rough month, to say the least, then you haven't met the internet.At least a few users, including Cyn Santana, seemed to feel for him.The tweet appeared to show Safaree, who is currently a cast member of Love & Hip Hop Hollywood, shifting his tone.</p>
<p>Just last March in an interview with Wendy Williams he was quick to say "Nah ... not at all,” when asked whether he and Nicki would get back together.And, just to thicken the plot even more, Safaree's ex, Star Divine, apparently responded to his tweet by suggesting he may be in the mix with Blac Chyna.We'll see how this plays out.</p></div>
