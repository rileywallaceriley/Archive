  <h1>Change Your Mindset: The Music Of Scotty Chams</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>In a shaky political climate and a world that's seemingly overrun by corporate and media influence, voice like that of Scotty Chams becomes a crucial balance in a sea of trapped-out music riding a wave of commercialism. "This project is mostly old school hip hop beats — but the style is unique and modern," he tells AAHH about his latest release, System Failure. "It's mostly talking about government corruption, different perspectives, a mindset to succeed, and my opinion on a lot of what's going on in our culture."

With over 3 million plays as an artist —which is impressive — the founder of "We The 9" has been building a steady buzz since he first dropped two years ago. "My music is based on following your passion and positivity — similar to Logic's vision.</p><p>I also talk a lot about spirituality, reality, and understanding."

A fresh welcomed addition to the game; check out some of Scotty's releases, below.</p><p>If you're feeling him, you can check out his social profiles to follow along.
