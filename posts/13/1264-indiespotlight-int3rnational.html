  <h1>#IndieSpotlight: Int3rnational</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>The last year of Michigan rapper Int3rnational's 17-year run in the hip-hop game has been the most real; most notably, he quit his 9-5 and is going at his dreams full-time.</p><p>That's a bold move for any artist, but also a necessary step if you plan to make it a lifetime career.</p><p>The grind is nothing new to the rapper, though.</p><p>Without many people to rely on early on, it had become a custom for INTL to take stages into his hands, booking the bulk of his gigs, and battles -- many of which he won.</p><p>So he's well-versed in handling his own career; his new focus will only serve to help him spread his brand of golden era goodness across the nation.</p><p>If you're a straight up underground, backpacker, substance-filled-bar loving head, this kid is right up your alley.</p><p>Across his catalog, which includes a record with famed Detroit producer Apollo Brown , he has a deceptively 90s sound that sounds like it's straight off a cassette dub from your favorite 90s college radio show.</p><p>Give Int3rnational a spin -- and if you're liking his material, follow him on <a href="https://twitter.com/intl_classics">Twitter</a>!
