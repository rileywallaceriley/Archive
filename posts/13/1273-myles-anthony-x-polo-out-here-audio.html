  <h1>Myles Anthony x Polo -- Out Here [audio]</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sun, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Surrey, British Columbia, is the province's&amp;nbsp;roughest city—in fact, in 2015, the city's crime rate had risen almost 36% as the result of a bloody gang war.</p><p>Surrey is the birthplace of rapper POLO, who is a longtime friend and collaborator of producer Myles Anthony, whose recent string of singles, including a collaboration of G.O.O.D Music head honcho Pusha T, have graced our blog. "Dude's the real deal in my opinion—and there's nothing out there but this," says Myles, when talking about his latest collaboration with POLO, the trap-tastic new record "Out Here." The bassy street record is a stark contrast from the more worldly joints we've heard from Myles over the past few months; however, it displays how refreshingly well rounded he is.</p><p>Also—TBH—the song is dripping with both authenticity and character.</p><p>The record, which displays POLO's true-to-life street raps, is a great example of what we can expect from his upcoming full-length project <i>Trapcouver</i>, which Myles is producing in its entirety.</p><p>That record is due out sometime in the New Year; as well, Myle's full-length is coming down the pipe, and with every new single that drops, we get more anxious to hear his vision fully realized.</p><p>Check out the new single below, and if you're feeling it mash the share button.
