    <h1>YBN Almighty Jay Under Suspicion For Allegedly Robbing SkinnyFromThe9 Of $80K</h1>
    <div class="meta">2019-02-18 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Four days after an alleged attempted-jumping by Zoey Dollaz, New Jersey rapper Skinnyfromthe9 was the victim of a Valentine’s Day robbery in Chatsworth, California — during which he lost a $40,000 chain, $20,000 Rolex, and $20,000 cash. Accordingly to law enforcement, one of the two suspects in the felony grand theft is none other than YBN Almighty Jay.Jay, who was filming a music video at the time, is allegedly seen on surveillance video (obtained by TMZ) approaching Skinnyfromthe9’s Range Rover with an associate, engaging in a brief struggling, then fleeing the scene.Afterward, sources told TMZ that Jay — who had apparently crashed at Skinnyfromthe9’s house while working on music just days prior — and his crew flexed the fruits of their “labor” as props in a social media skit.</p>
<p>The investigation is currently underway, and neither rappers or their team have released any statements.</p></div>
