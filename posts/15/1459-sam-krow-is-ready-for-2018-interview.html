  <div class="content"><p>Sam Krow a.k.a.</p><p>Hunnit Block from Dade County, Florida (by way of Little Haiti), has been <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/sam-krow-connects-with-zoey-dollaz-for-hunnid/">featured on our site in the past</a>.</p><p>His single “Hunnit” featuring Zoey Dollaz—who is having serious run right now—and his <em>Black On Black</em> mixtape put him on the map within his local scene, and his upcoming EP <em>Zoe Boy</em> promises to open him up to the world.

“ is down south blended with the heartbeat of the islands,” he tells AAHH. “My mother was my inspiration.</p><p>Before she died we listened to music together; then, when she died I used the memory of my mom as my pain reliever—my tranquility place.</p><p>My anger releaser,” he continues. “That’s when I was motivated to do what I wanted to do in life…to make my mom proud.”

“My influence was the black stars in my neighborhood,” he told us, noting he was musically fuelled by Biggie, Pac, Bob Marley, Michel Martelly, Wyclef and the Fugees, Trick, Uncle Luke, and MMG capo Rick Ross.</p><p>He has a lot to look forward to, especially following the success of “Hunnit” which peaked at 83 on the national DRT charts—and number 8 the indie DRT chart. “ to build a legacy, not only for my children but my people,” he says confidently.</p><p>With a freshman album on deck for 2018 and a major tour in the works, it’s only a matter of time before Sam’s name is mentioned in larger industry circles.</p></div>
