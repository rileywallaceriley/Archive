The game is full of young cats searching for their big break, chasing down labels for a way into the game.</p><p>There is something to be said, though, for the entrepreneurial minds who journey the road less-traveled in search of prosperous opportunities.</p><p>We've seen many indie cats take the game to the next level over the past few years; young rappers like Mac Miller and Joey Badass have used the power of the Internet to build followings outside of staunch label structure we've become accustomed to.</p><p>NYC native Yahiness is another such mind, who is poised to do big things this year.</p><p>He's is Co-CEO and the first recording artist of The Arkk 7 Inc., a creative firm that dabbles in music, films and media.</p><p>The 25 years old Southside Jamaica Queens native has been featured on MTV2's <em>The Sucker Free Countdown</em> and on MTV2's <em>Weekend Jams Hot 16</em>.
