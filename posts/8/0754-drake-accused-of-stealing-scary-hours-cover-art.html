  <h1>Drake Accused Of Stealing "Scary Hours" Cover Art</h1>
  <div class="meta">2018-01-23 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Drake fans were treated to two new singles, "God's Plan" and "Diplomatic Immunity," packed together as Scary Hours this past weekend.</p><p>But everyone wasn't happy about the EP's arrival, including Texas-based electronic music producer Eric Burton -- better known as Rabit.</p><p>According to him, the EP's cover art was stolen."Today I wake up to see OVO has redone one of my 2015 tour posters designed by @collindfletcher for Drake's new single," Rabit wrote on Instagram. "Poor Collin is always having his style stolen. lol BUT I love being part of a team that's so creative and iconic."Rabit hoped the alleged theft would raise awareness about the prevalence of such acts in the music industry.“This is a story that too many artists, musicians, and designers identify with,” Fletcher noted in a statement to Pitchfork. “Hopefully this results in a larger conversation about popular culture's relationship to underground artists.”Although whoever designed the Scary Hours artwork for Drake is ultimately responsible, this isn't the first time Drizzy has been accused of stealing art.</p><p>From flows to larger artistic concepts, the OVO leader has dealt with his share of criticism and accusations.</p><p>An example is back in 2015 when he allegedly used an artist's piece on his Instagram without providing any credit.</p></div>
