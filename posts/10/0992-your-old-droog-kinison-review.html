  <h1>Your Old Droog – Kinison</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I've been known to shower Your Old Droog with praise – in fact he was one of my <a title="Special’s Top 5 of 2014: #5 Your Old Droog" href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/specials-top-5-2014-5-old-droog/">top 5 of 2014</a>; although, it's hard to argue the opposite.</p><p>It's not often in today's landscape that a white rapper isn't even acknowledged by critics as a white rapper.</p><p>Maybe that's because he isn't part of the problem in today's hip-hop culture.</p><p>If anything he's a trailblazer who's helping to steer our ship towards the promised land it was once on course for.</p><p>Much like Action Bronson, his ora seems authentic, making his appeal less forced than some of his peers.
<blockquote>Back in the line of fire – saying my style is dated is like is checking to see if wine expires.

– Your Old Droog from the song <em>Porno For Pyros</em></blockquote>
True to his out of nowhere approach, the once faceless (Nas-ish sounding) Droog dropped his latest EP yesterday called <em>Kinison</em>, much to my joy.</p><p>While his first album was full of gritty jazz, soul and funk samples – tamed by DJ Skizz – this latest effort contains a cornucopia of rock nods; however, this album is (sonically) all hip-hop sans the 90's rock references sprinkled throughout.</p><p>Droog expands his production team slightly as El RMTC and Marco Polo help Skizz with heavy lifting this time around.</p><p>This album is full of bangers.</p><p>Standouts for me were the Skizz produced <em>Porno For Pyros</em>, which I recognized from his <a href="hhttp://youtu.be/CZZO9EueT4s?t=2m29s">Sway appearance</a>, <em>Gentrify My Hood</em>, in which Droog discusses CI's (apparent) lack of amenities and lastly the Marco Polo produced <em>Sonic Youth</em>.</p><p>Understand me though, that's subjective, because tracks like <em>Blood</em> and <em>Homicide</em> will have you breaking rewind buttons.</p><p>There is literally no filler.</p><p>He's more than a similar voice.</p><p>Droog stays true to himself, and once again puts together a cohesive project that ignores conventions (set by radio and mass media).</p><p>This album seems slightly more approachable for some reason – I'm struggling to fully put my finger on it – which may make him slightly easier for some to digest.</p><p>With an upcoming tour with PRhyme 2015 is looking like a good year for CI's finest.</p><p>Get familiar.
