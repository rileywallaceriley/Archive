  <h1>Don't Sleep on M-Dot</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>M-Dot is a name that's been floating around in my circle for a while; even his team has been on me over Instagram.</p><p>The last straw was when a member of the Snowgoons camp shot me an email last week asking me if I'd heard his latest single (produced by them).</p><p>I thought to myself, "I'm missing out." So I popped in <a href="https://m-dotboston.bandcamp.com/album/ego-and-the-enemy"><em>Ego And The Enemy</em></a> and zoned out for two complete spins--man, did I sleep on him.</p><p>At seventeen gems, the Boston rapper has a super impressive line-up of production credits on here, like Snowgoons (whose Goon Bap was one of my top albums of 2016), Large Professor, Marco Polo, Buckwild, Hi-Tek, and more--not to mention cuts from the legendary Marley Marl.</p><p>There are also some guest vocals from the likes of Method Man, the elusive Krumb Snatcha, and Camp-Lo, who recently celebrated 20 years since their debut album Uptown Saturday Night.</p><p>Bar-wise, the dude is legit--which wasn't surprising; his bar over bar flow (reminiscent of RA Da Ruggedman) and track record of features is insane, and he's toured the world and shared stages with royalty.</p><p>This doesn't seem forced--he's not at all a culture vulture just dropping dollars to give tech effect of credibility; he's earned his stripes.</p><p>He's won regional accolades previously granted to artists like Guru, Edo G, Mr.</p><p>Lif--so, he's in the lane. <a href="https://m-dotboston.bandcamp.com/album/ego-and-the-enemy"><em>Ego And The Enemy</em></a> is a fresh listen; my personal highlights were "Gleamin'" (the record with Marley Marl cuts), "Shine" with Meth.</p><p>Also, don't snooze on "Fugazzi," which recently got a video treatment.</p><p>Get up on M-dot!!!</p><p>Early.
