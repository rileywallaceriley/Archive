  <h1>Mr P. Chill Gets Real On 'The Beautiful Revolution'</h1>

  <div class="content"><p><blockquote>"The Beautiful Revolution leans on the belief that  to change the world, one must first start with healing their  personal scars, which, is a revolution in itself." --Mr.</p><p>P Chill</blockquote>
Mr.</p><p>P Chill has been written about before here at AAHH; Still Standing was a solute to the supporters and fans who have kept him going throughout his 23-year marriage to this hip-hop game.</p><p>His latest record, <em>The Beautiful Revolution</em>, is much more about transcending his music and putting out messages of hope and inspiration, while raising a fist and shaking it intensely at the oppressive powers that current 'rule' over society.</p><p>In contrast to <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/mr-p-chill-23-years-in-the-game/"><em>Still Standing</em></a>--in many ways--it's much more introspective and personal.</p><p>On the record "I Wanna Go Home," he alludes to loss and describes his town to town lifestyle as a lonely, never ending search for something he can't quite find. "If these Tattoos Could Talk" is a walk down memory lane with the rapper as he describes the meaning behind all of the ink on his body. "Fighting For The Mic," which is a little more light-hearted, is a subtle nod to the early days when he struggled as a white-rapper, fighting for support as he chased his dreams.</p><p>Records like "<a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/p-chill-pens-letter-to-corrupt-police/">Dear Crooked Cop</a>," which we posted a month or so back, and "Beautiful Revolution," featuring J.Smo focus on the social injustice and tension between communities and law-enforcement being felt across the country; it's interesting, as he is a white rapper.</p><p>Not too many are this outspoken--it truly makes the subject less racial and more human.</p><p>A good portion of the other records focuses on the sheer volume of mind-boggling things happening across the nation--from the election results to various forms of racial/socio-political and economic discrimination taking place.</p><p>The balance of this project is the fact that there are checks and balances--as much awareness as it brings to the ill of today's  realities, it also provides motivation for change. "Change The World," for example, shows the forward thinking P has about the power of his music and platform.</p><p>He also once again links up with Spyder D--the first rapper in history to release an independent record-- for the funky "Gonna Be Alright," which serves as the outro and perfect decompression track.</p><p>Production-wise, the album is much more dynamic than the last, with some eclectic vibes that remain cohesive to the overall thematic flow of the sequencing--which is quite good.</p><p>Beats like the Lionel Richie-sampled "Hello" and the Buffalo Springfield-sampled "Right In Front Of Your Eyes" add lots of depth to the project.</p><p>Overall, another dope release from P. Chill--one of the hardest-working indie rappers we know!
