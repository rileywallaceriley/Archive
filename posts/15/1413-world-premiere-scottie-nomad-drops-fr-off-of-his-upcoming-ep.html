  <h1>World Premiere: Scottie Nomad Drops 'FR'</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Setbacks and experience help breed some of the rawest music; nobody knows this as well as Beantown MC Scottie Nomad.</p><p>Scottie started making music back in his high school and had a nice little buzz brewing until that street life caught up with him.</p><p>He caught a slew of gun and drug charges that cost him a 8 to 16-year bid -- though he ultimately served eight.</p><p>After his first taste of freedom back in 2015, he returned to Boston determined to put his everything into pursuing this music game.
<blockquote>"Went away for like eight summers/If I don't make it Imma take something."</blockquote>
He's been full stream ahead, and -- this September -- he's slated to drop what he hopes will be his breakthrough EP, No Man's Land.</p><p>He was gracious enough to give AAHH a premiere oof his first offering from the project, "FR." An acronym for "For Real," the slow trappy vibes provided by TheBeatPlug provides a perfect sound bed for Scottie to drop bars oozing with an air of authenticity.</p><p>It's an enticing preview of what he has on deck for the full release
