  <div class="content"><p>The number of rappers that died in 2022—particularly those who had yet to fully flourish before meeting untimely fates—was nothing short of soul-crushing.</p><p>With so many young lives lost, some as young as 15, Hip Hop continued to feel like, in the words of GZA, a deadly video game with just one man.</p><p>With ambitions of success and social media clout seemingly overriding a desire to use platforms to better their situations, rapping remained one of the most dangerous professions in America this year.It is heartbreaking to realize that despite achieving success, remaining a part of the popular street-centric culture, often rife with jealousy, leaves rappers with targets on their backs, like antelopes in lion enclosures (as we saw with Takeoff and PNB Rock).Although beyond the gun smoke, the culture once lost more legends this year from health-related causes; DJ Kay Slay from COVID-19, Coolio from cardiac arrest and Hurricane G from cancer—not to mention whose cause of death was not revealed, like Tame One and Grand Daddy I.U.HipHopDX has once again compiled an tragically long, annual round-up not only recognizing the legends of we've but (more depressingly) the younger and less established acts who never saw their full potential.</p><p>On a somber note, here are the rappers who died in 2022.TakeOff28-year-old TakeOff, one-third of the Grammy-nominated, Atlanta-based group Migos, died on November 1 after being shot three times outside of 810 Billiards & Bowling in Houston, Texas, where he was attending a private function with his uncle—and fellow Migo—Quavo.</p><p>Following an altercation that didn't involve him, multiple shots rang out, leaving the rapper slain and two others injured.While initially thought to have been a case of the rapper catching stray shots, The Harris County medical examiner ruled the shooting a homicide days later.</p><p>Patrick Xavier Clark has since been charged with the murder and is currently being held on a $1 million bond.Pnb RockPhilly rapper PnB Rock's life ended on September 12, when he was shot and killed in a deadly robbery while having lunch with his girlfriend, Stephanie Sibounheuang, at a Los Angeles location of Roscoe's House of Chicken' N Waffles.https://youtu.be/ca0h9TnbTIoOriginally thought to be the result of Sibounheuang revealing their location in an Instagram story, it was later revealed that Freddie Lee Trone (and his underage son) targeted the rapper when they saw him enter the restaurant wearing jewellery.</p><p>The two, along with Trone's wife, have all been given numerous charges related to the killing.DJ Kay SlayDJ Kay Slay, a Hip Hop fixture, mixtape legend and legendary radio personality (whose presence in the culture dates back to the iconic 1983 documentary Style Wars), passed away on April 17 after a four-month battle with COVID-19.He first caught the pandemic virus in January, at one point rumored to be on a ventilator; however, his brother shot down that claim, noting that Slay did have another machine helping him breathe at one point.</p><p>He also gave the news that the DJ had begun to show signs of recovery, giving way to a collective sigh of relief.However, despite positive progress, he struggled to get back to 100%, eventually succumbing to complications from the virus.</p><p>He was 55 years old.Hurricane GHurricane G, a well-respected, pioneering Boricua MC, passed away on November 6.</p><p>Months earlier, it was announced that the Brooklyn native was gracefully and optimistically battling Stage 4 lung cancer--a diagnosis revealed on the Facebook page of her daughter Lexus, whom she parented with iconic MC/producer Erick Sermon.https://youtu.be/uLjYMT_14Vw?t=135The First Lady of Sermon's Def Squad, G rose to prominence in the 90s, appearing on classic albums by Redman, Erick Sermon, Keith Murray (and others) before dropping her debut LP, All Woman, which featured the top-10 hit "Somebody Else."

he was 52 years old.Pat StayThe battle tap community was devastated following the news that 36-year-old Canadian MC Pat Stay, who first made his debut in the Toronto-based King of the Dot (KOTD) battle rap league, had been killed in his hometown of Halifax, Nova Scotia.</p><p>The rapper was fatally stabbed after trying to stop a fight inside the downtown bar Yacht Club Social on September 4.</p><p>He was rushed to the Halifax Infirmary but was pronounced dead soon after.https://youtu.be/9tIQg69imvQFollowing his death, there was an outpouring of love from industry titans, including Eminem, who dubbed him one of the greatest battle rappers of all time.</p><p>He leaves behind two children and a common-law spouse.DJ 50 GrandEvery legend has an origin story, and for the Notorious BIG, that story included a then 21-year-old DJ 50 Grand, who started working with the iconic rapper when he was just 15.</p><p>An infamous demo tape recorded in the DJ's basement was put in the hands of Mister Cee, who shared it with journalist Matty C, director of The Source Magazine's once coveted Unsigned Hype column.</p><p>That appearance in The Source put the Brooklyn MC on the radar of a then-unknown Sean Combs.https://youtu.be/vsYiwXZvvpAConsidering just how much Biggie would ultimately mean to the culture of Hip Hop, widely regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time, 50 Grand's contribution deserves as many flowers as possible.</p><p>His cause of death was not released;
