  <h1>3 90's Records Flipped By Coke Boys</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Coke Boys, which for the sake of a long-winded explanation is a record label founded by French Montana and incarcerated rapper Max B in 2008, have sure seen some extraordinary ups, and heartbreaking lows over the 7 years.</p><p>I mean, they are an imprint on both Bad Boy Records and Maybach Music Group – no big deal.</p><p>They’ve signed chart bullies like Lil Durk, and the late <a title="Rapper Chinx Dies At Age 31" href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/rapper-chinx-dies-at-age-31/">Chinx, who was unfortunately murdered late last month</a>.</p><p>As well, Max B got knocked for conspiracy to commit murder, and is currently serving 20+ years; although, there’s been some rumours he will walk the streets of NYC next year.</p><p>One thing that <i>consistently</i> speaks volumes is the music that French and his associates put out.</p><p>In particular, I want to focus on their beat selection.</p><p>They have a track record of flipping 90’s classics and making smash hits that dominate summers at a time.</p><p>Here are three that particularly stand out to me.

<strong>French Montana &amp; Chinx feat Noreaga – <em>Off The Rip</em> produced by Trakformaz</strong>



This one is a flip of the record <a href=" For The Night</em></a>, by Flip Mode Squad associate Rampage The Last Boyscout, who is also a cousin of the dungeon dragon himself Busta Rhymes.</p><p>The track originally appeared on Rampage’s gold selling solo <em>LP <a href=" Honor... </a></em>by<a href=" Way of Blood</em></a>.</p><p>It stands as perhaps his most recognizable (solo) single; however, Rampage is still active.</p><p>You can follow him on Twitter.&amp;nbsp;The track also “borrows" lyrically from Capone N Noreaga’s <a href=" Money</em></a>.</p><p>Noreaga also appears on the song, and in the video.

<b>Chinx</b><strong> feat French Montana – <em>I’m a Coke Boy</em> produced by Harry Fraud</strong>



This one is a flip of the classic NYC street record <a href=" by Queens rapper – and close Mic Geronimo associate – Royal Flush.</p><p>The track originally appeared on Flush's 1997 debut album, <a href=" Millionaire</em></a>, which featured production from Buckwild, L.E.S., Da Beatminerz.</p><p>It also featured the dope b-side record <a href=" Down Medallions</em></a>.

<strong>French Montana – <em>Pop That</em> produced by Lee On the Beats</strong>



This track is a flip of Luke’s first record as a solo artist, <a href=" </em></a>Wanna<em> Rock</em> aka Doo Doo Brown.</p><p>Luke has a long dicey <em>and</em> monumental history in the music industry.</p><p>In fact, he was a catalyst for the <a href="https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=luthur+campbell+war+on+censorship">censorship wars</a> of rap's infancy.</p><p>Read up on him, it’s worthy of your time I promise.</p><p>This song in particular was seen as a pivotal point in Miami Bass, and was released on the heels of the final 2 Live Crew album.
