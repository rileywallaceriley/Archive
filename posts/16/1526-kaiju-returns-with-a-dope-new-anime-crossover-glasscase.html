  <h1>Kaiju Returns With A Dope New Anime Crossover “Glasscase”</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Kaiju The Unconquerable is back; one of the best-kept secrets on AAHH continues with his string of high-quality visuals with his latest Anime crossover concept, “Ep.9: Glasscase.” This time around, he plays the role of Sie — a transporter finds himself in a tight situation when he runs into a kidnapping of a gorgeous girl by the name of
Tomi.

<h4><a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/?s=Kaiju">Relevant: Check Out Previous Kaiju Coverage</a></h4>

After rescuing the gorgeous woman — whom two crooked police officers were paid by the mafia to steal the organs from — their escape becomes a low-key hilarious attempt at getting the digits.</p><p>As always, the quality is high, and while interspersed with cartoonish overlays to give it a comic feel, there are actual quick cuts to fully animated Anime sequences, adding to the overall visual complexity of the treatment.</p><p>I’ve brought this up pretty much every time I share this guys shit, but the songs are always standalone even without the visual treatment.</p><p>Subtract the video, and the track itself is fun as hell, filled with his usual brand of nerdery, intertwined with a plethora of penis punchlines and puns, like how she calls his D “ridiculous,” or how he’s not British but has a “BBC.”

The tone itself, aside from the more humorous tone, is more in line with a joint like “Ultraman,”
In contrast to the more aggressive aura of his last installment, “Got II.” There has yet to be a collective body of work, but it’s definitely going to be an absolute banger.</p><p>All in all, this guy remains a gem secret worth discovering.</p><p>In the words of Pusha T, “If you know, you know.”
