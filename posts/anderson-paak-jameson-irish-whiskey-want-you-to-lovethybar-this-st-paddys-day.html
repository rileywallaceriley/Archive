    <div class="content"><p>With St. Patrick’s Day right around the corner, Jameson Irish Whiskey has teamed up with Anderson .Paak for a new campaign aimed at supporting local bars across America.The #LoveThyBar campaign is encouraging drinkers to visit a local bar and try a Jameson beverage on the company's dime."To let you know we're serious, Jameson is pledging up to $1 million towards our program to help consumers try Jameson and support their local neighborhood bars in America," Jameson Vice President Paul Di Vito says in a press release. “This connection to local neighborhoods across the country is a big part of what has shaped Jameson into what it is today and it's vital that we show our support and commitment to keeping these institutions of culture and community alive."Paak says the collaboration with Jameson was a natural fit for him because it’s part of his story."It feels like nearly all the bars that we came up in within our hometown are done ... music will suffer if we don't value the local spots,” he explains. “As an artist or a person, you need to go bounce stuff off real people, new people, strange people and discover yourself through being around others."Claiming your drink rebate is easy. Chat with Jameson through Facebook Messenger, head to your local bar and send them an image of your receipt.The promotion runs throughout March.</p>
