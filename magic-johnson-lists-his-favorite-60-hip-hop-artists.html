    <div class="meta">2019-08-14 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Former Los Angeles Lakers star Magic Johnson is incredibly gifted in many aspects. However, properly ranking music artists isn’t one of them.In celebration of his 60th birthday, the NBA great decided to give his Twitter followers numerous top 60 lists of everything from television shows to athletes-turned-entrepreneurs.However, it was his music lists that seem to have driven Twitter the nuttiest.In a sea of recent Hip Hop lists, Magic’s seemed to satisfy purists, including names like Kool Moe Dee and Bone Thugs-N-Harmony.</p>
<p>There are also numerous female acts included such as MC Lyte, Salt-N-Pepa and Lil' Kim.Though it becomes clear that after No. 4 he's just listing artists alphabetically rather than committing to actual ranking, some understandably missed the rationale.You can check out all of his lists below. Happy Birthday, Magic.</p></div>
