    <h1>Beyoncé & JAY-Z Offer Lifetime Tickets To Vegan Challenge Winner</h1>
    <div class="meta">2019-01-31 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Have you been on the fence with adopting a vegan lifestyle? JAY-Z and Beyoncé are offering fans a little extra incentive: free tickets to any of their shows, anywhere, for life.</p>
<p>The contest, part of The Greenprint Project, was announced Wednesday (January 30) via Beyoncé’s Instagram.Going vegan is a choice that may be an intuitive next step for vegetarians, but a huge leap for anyone who currently eats meat. For this reason, the contest is focusing on inspiring individuals to adopt manageable commitments for eligibility, such as two plant-based meals a day or “Meatless Mondays.”The contest and corresponding website — which helps illustrate the positive impact that small commitments to plant-based meals can have on the planet — is the second phase of the overall The Greenprint Project.</p>
<p>Conceived by Marco Borges, who founded and co-owns 22 DAYS NUTRITION with JAY-Z and Beyoncé, the project started with a book released on December 31, The Greenprint: Plant-Based Diet, Best Body, Better World (which includes an introduction by the power couple), and will culminate with a documentary film later this fall.You can learn more and enter the contest, here.[apple_news_ad type="standard"]</p></div>
