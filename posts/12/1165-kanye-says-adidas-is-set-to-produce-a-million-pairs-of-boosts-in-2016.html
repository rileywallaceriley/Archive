  <h1>Kanye Says Adidas Is Set To Produce A Million Pairs Of Boosts In 2016</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sat, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>The West-Kardashian clan certainly knows how to command the internet's attention.</p><p>A few short days after Kim announced via Twitter that she had paid off Kanye's massive $53 million debt – and broke the web with her NSFW Instagram post – Ye took to Twitter and announced that Adidas was set to produce one million pairs of Yeezy Boosts in 2016.</p><p>This is welcomed news for those anxious to get their hands on the coveted sneakers.</p><p>The move would make sense, considering that upon their initial release last year -- and subsequent drops -- the sneakers have sold out in mere minutes; however, the production run was dramatically lower than one million.</p><p>In fact, the last Moonrock drop was around 80,000 units.</p><p>The lack of availability has had mixed responses from sneaker heads, and driven up prices online, which have surpassed $1200 dollars on many online marketplaces.</p><p>This enormous ramp-up in production could help more fans get their feet into Boosts this year.

2016 has been fruitful thus far for Kanye, with TLOP enjoying a positive reception from fans, Season 3 selling out Madison Square Garden in ten minutes and streaming around the world, and the birth -- and grand reveal -- of his son, Saint.</p><p>This announcement, which has yet to be confirmed by Adidas, comes fresh on the heels of the news that TLOP physical copies would be available within a few weeks.</p><p>We'll have to wait for official confirmation, as Kanye's Twitter has been known be a mix of both informative truths and ranty pie-in-the-sky rhetoric.</p><p>Perhaps in 2016, though, Yeezy will definitively "jump over Jumpman."</p></div>
