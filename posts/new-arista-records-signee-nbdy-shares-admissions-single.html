    <div class="content"><p>Newark, New Jersey, native NBDY is helping to usher in a new era for the recently relaunched Arista Records with his first release on the imprint, “Admissions.”“The song came from a place in my past that crippled me for so long,” he explains via the label's press release. “It was my first heartbreak. I wanted to take the listener back to that moment, explicitly giving them the full experience.”NBDY hopes his tenure on Arista will put him on the path to curbing the generational curse in his family.</p>
<p>His father, mother, aunts, and cousins all attempted to pursue music in the past, but to little fanfare.His father signed with Sony music 20 years ago after striking up a relationship with Wyclef Jean.“During my official signing, my dad looked at me and said, ‘It’s like watching me all over again, you’re just doing it better,” he continued.Check out NBDY’s “Admissions” above.[apple_news_ad type="standard"]</p></div>
