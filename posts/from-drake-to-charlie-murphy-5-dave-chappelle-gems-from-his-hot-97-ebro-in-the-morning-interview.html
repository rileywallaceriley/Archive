    <div class="content"><p>Iconic comedian Dave Chappelle stopped by Hot 97 yesterday to "take over" Ebro In The Morning, alongside Ebro Darden, Peter Rosenberg, and Laura Stylez. Throughout the one-hour segment, Chappelle plugged his epic run at Radio City Music Hall, located in New York City's Rockefeller Center, and dropped a plethora of gems and insights.Dave Doesn't Knock Drake For Using GhostwritersEmbed from Getty ImagesDiscussion about his interview with Kendrick Lamar for Interview Magazine seamlessly transitioned into Rosenberg asking Chappelle his thoughts on Drake -- in contrast to Kung-Fu Kenny -- not writing his lyrics."When it comes to art, results matter," he responded. "If I hear a Drake record and enjoy it, then somebody comes up behind me and tells me what's in the hot dog ... I still ate (and enjoyed) the hot dog," he explained."When it comes to making art, though, I like to do it myself," he quickly added. "But I never knock anyone who creates art by committee ... results matter."His Relationship w/ Prince Blossomed Upon End Of Chappelle's Showhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZxYjqqjZMWhen asked by Rosenberg about his relationship with Prince, Chappelle explained that Prince was onto him early. "Even back when I was doing comedy clubs in New York, Prince used to come check me out," he revealed. "When I quit my show," he continued, "I think we became friends." Ebro added "Prince respected that," which Chappelle agreed with."I was going through my grown up stuff," he said. "There are things that he told me that -- had he told me before [I quit] -- I wouldn't have understood yet ... there are some wild woods out there," he said, as he segued into the experience of quitting the show the way he did. "I wouldn't recommend it."He Didn't Know Charlie Murphy Was SickWhen asked about the late Charlie Murphy, Chappelle noted that he didn't know that fellow comedian and friend was sick. "I'm not sure if I'm glad ... or I feel guilty about that," he told the cast, who noted that they also didn't know. "There were a lot of people at the funeral who were closer to Charlie than I was, who also said they didn't know.</p>
<p>He was just really private about what he was going through.""To say I'm grateful to have met that guy would be an understatement," he added. "I feel like he's the biggest reason I'm successful. We were just sitting in the lunch room, and he said 'I fought Rick James many times' ... that conversation changed my life."R.</p>
<p>Kelly "(I Wanna) Piss On You" Skit Almost Got Flushedhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw8CxyQx4zEOne of the best gems Chappelle dropped was that the skit in which he -- according to Rosenberg -- "bodied R. Kelly," was almost cut from the show. "I was going to cut it," he admits, "but when I watched it, it was so funny." He explained that the crisis was that he wondered if the audience could handle it.</p>
<p>Ultimately he left it in.Rosenberg touted that the skit helped define the collective perception of R. Kelly for years to come.</p>
<p>This ring true, even considering the reaction to the singer's latest of round of controversy involving allegations of running a sex cult.Also, in case you missed it, the skit also starred a Cuban-American model Vida Guerra -- which you can see in the screenshot.Radio City Music Hall 30 Years-Strong In ComedyWhile discussing the 24-night run at the historic venue, Chappelle told the cast that the last night, which will feature a very special guest -- who he's keeping under wraps -- is his 44th birthday, which also marks his 30th year in comedy.The venue, as it turns out, also holds significance as it was where he had his first show (outside of comedy clubs). "I opened up for Aretha Franklin," he revealed.Dave's run at Radio City Music Hall is almost entirely sold out and includes guest hosts like Chris Rock, Trevor Noah, Childish Gambino, and Lauryn Hill, as well as epic performances by Ice Cube, Chance The Rapper, Yasiin Bey and Talib Kweli, and much more.
