  <h1>Swizz Beatz Will Give You $5K To Put On An Art Show</h1>
  <div class="meta">2018-05-10 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>The Dean Collection — a contemporary family art collection founded by Swizz Beatz and wife Alicia Keys — is giving creatives a platform to help jumpstart their careers.“It's time for you to start taking your creativity into your own hands,” Swizz said via an Instagram video announcing his new initiative. “It’s time to start taking your business into your own hands.”The Dean Collection 20 St(art)ups will award 20 artists around the globe with $5000 to do their own show.</p><p>There is no catch or artistic restrictions. “It doesn't matter what medium you use as an artist,” he says. "What if I told you that it doesn't even have to be in the gallery?</p><p>It can be any space that represents you.”Much like the lauded No Commission art fair, which has been to various cities in the U.S. and abroad, the 20 artists selected won’t be required to provide The Dean Collection with a cut of any sales.“This contest is not even a contest,” Swizz adds. “This is an opportunity.”Anyone interested can apply on The Dean Collection’s website and use the #TDC20 hashtag to tag your work via Instagram and Twitter.</p><p>The deadline is May 31.Here are some of the entries that have already popped up.</p></div>
