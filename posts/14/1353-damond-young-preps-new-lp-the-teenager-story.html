<strong>Tell me about your sound, what are your influences?
</strong>
My sound is universal and vintage; I got introduced to music at age 13.</p><p>The first person that introduced me to music was my older cousin.</p><p>Since then I've drawn a lot of influence from acts like 2pac, Lil' Wayne, Jay-Z, Nas, Kanye West, Coldplay and more.

<strong>What are you currently working on?
</strong>
Currently, I'm working on the marketing and videos for <em>The Teenager Story</em>.

<strong>What would you say have been your biggest achievements thus far?
</strong>
In 2010, I was featured as one of hottest artists from New Orleans on Worldstarhiphop--I rapped over a Dead Prez track, back when my stage name was DY.</p><p>My record "Love," which you guys featured here, reached millions of views; and, finally, I shook hands with Jay-Z during all-star weekend 2017.

<strong>What are your industry goals?
</strong>
Goals for industry stay Humble and do things the world hasn't seen yet.

<strong>What's next for you--beyond the album?
</strong>
Marketing, shooting videos, modeling, acting--yes, I'm going to be an actor--and just keep creating, God willing.</p></div>
