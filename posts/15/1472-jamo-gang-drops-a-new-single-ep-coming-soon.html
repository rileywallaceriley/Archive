  <h1>Jamo Gang Drops A New Single—EP Coming Soon</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>2017 was a year full of unexpected and surprising collaborative efforts that real hip-hop heads could be excited about.</p><p>Only one week into 2018, and we’ve already been given something to look forward to.</p><p>The super lyrical one Ras Kass — who just last month dropped <em>Year End Closeout</em>, a dope playlist of new music — and MC El Gant has joined forces with producer J57 of the Brown Bag All-Stars to form Jamo Gang.</p><p>NOW, to be clear this isn’t left field; DJ Premier dropped a teaser video co-signing the trio last year around this time, and a few loosies were dropped, but a full project failed to materialize until now.

Earlier this week they dropped the first leak from their self-titled EP via HipHopDX, and — as expected — it’s a bucket of flame emojis.</p><p>I’m a huge fan of all three of these guys; Gant and Ras have worked together a few times, and I’ve always thought they’d sound great with a more substantial more focused body of work.</p><p>I’m also still here for single producer projects, and J57, who is so dope that cats fully couldn’t distinguish some of his beats from Premier (who he worked with heavily at one point), is the icing on the cake.


&amp;nbsp;
The <i>Jamo Gang</i> EP is expected to arrive on 1-30-18 and comes with a bonus track from DJ Premier.
