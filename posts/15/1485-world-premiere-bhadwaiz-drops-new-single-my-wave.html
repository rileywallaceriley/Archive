  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Ohio-based rapper Bhadwaiz likens himself as someone who brings hope to those around him; a shining example that following your dreams can pay off. “All I really wanna do is ride my wave,” he says confidently.</p><p>Having generated some buzz on the Ohio scene for a minute, his first release of 2018, “My Wave,” is poised to take him to the next level.

"Straight to the point, I want this song to be the anthem for people who want to do their own thing, their way—and without any doubt,” he says. “This song is a mixture of contemporary and traditional hip-hop.</p><p>When I say that, I mean the production is similar to what you hear today, but the lyrics are what makes the track stand out.”

“When people hear this for the first time, I want them to take notice of what I'm trying to do and what lane I'm in,” he continues. “I want people to appreciate this track in all aspects, and I know they will.</p><p>I'm very confident if done right; it will be my breakout track, and I can't wait for what's in store after this.“

"My Wave" by Bhadwaiz will be available for purchase through iTunes -- or whatever streaming network floats your boat.</p><p>Check out the exclusive premiere, below.
