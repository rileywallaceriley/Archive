  <div class="meta">2018-04-11 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>One week after dropping the much-acclaimed Care For Me album , Saba dropped by Sway In The Morning to discuss the project and share his reaction to its early success."Milestones and accolades add up," Saba said, noting the LP debuted at #43 on the Billboard 200. "That's not what it's all about ... but it does mean a lot ."Although things are bright now, Saba described the period when he made the album as the lowest time of his life."It's a super honest, emotional rap album ...</p><p>It was like therapy to me," he said. "It's the opposite album of what I wanted to make.</p><p>Even when I tried to write something fun, it came out dark."Though the project was inspired by painful moments in the Chicago MC's life, Sway was quick to interject and note "when you listen to the album, you  feel good ... that's the irony of all this."In contrast to his past work, Saba kept the LP 's progress under tight wraps.</p><p>He allowed nobody outside of the album's co-producers, daedaePIVOT and Daoud, to hear it during its creation.Check out the entire Sway appearance, which includes a freestyle, above and look out for Saba on his Care For Me tour beginning Wednesday night (April 11) in Philadelphia.</p></div>
