    <h1>Khalid Performs Intimate Version Of “Better” At VEVO’s LA Cottage</h1>
    <div class="meta">2018-11-13 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>After releasing a (surprise) captivating visual for the song “Better” on November 9th, Khalid — currently touring Japan — dropped a stripped down acoustic version of his song “Better” performed at Vevo’s LA cottage.https://youtu.be/x3bfa3DZ8JMBacked by a guitar and some talented singers, this version adds a different dimension in contrast to the bassy original, which was crafted by platinum-producer Charlie Handsome — the beat-smith behind massive tracks like Kanye West’s “Fade,” and who also joined the lineup on Drake’s “Madiba Riddim” off More Life.The song is the first single off his EP Suncity — a reference to his hometown of El Paso, Texas. It’s the official follow-up to his critically acclaimed debut LP, American Teen, which includes the quadruple-platinum single “Location.” [apple_news_ad type="standard"]</p></div>
