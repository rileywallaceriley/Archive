<b>How did you get involved in DJ'ing?</b>

It kinda started by accident; I was curious about radio sounds and
messing around with equipment in the house.</p><p>Got my first Turntable at 9, started doing College parties for my sister around 12.</p><p>From there I knew I wanted to keep going… I liked it too much, and I never looked back.

<b>Who are some of your influences?</b>

DJ Kool Herc!</p><p>A significant influence for doing what he did .</p><p>Most DJ’s and Artist forget about that.</p><p>DJ AM has been a huge influence on me growing up; I loved his musical range and creativity.</p><p>DJ Riz DJ Sizzahandz -- The Crooklyn Clan.</p><p>I have a lot of respect and admiration for the pioneers of the game who elevated the craft.

<b>Describe yourself as a DJ -- what's your sound?</p><p>What do you love to spin?</b>

I pride myself as an open format DJ, so my sound is high-energy and all over the place.</p><p>Depending on the night and crowd, I’m doing anything from Hip-hop/R&amp;B and dancehall reggae to tribal house, Dance - Trap, reggaeton or bachata; I even hit the crowd with some slow jams this past weekend!</p><p>And they LOVED IT!

<b>Do you create your own music?</b>

Yeah, I make my music, but I wouldn’t consider myself a producer at this point.</p><p>My primary focus is on getting better with my technical DJ skills and finding new creative ways to get the crowd moving.</p><p>I'm a DJ 1st!

<b>What makes you unique as a DJ?</b>

My energy for sure; I try to develop a relationship with the crowd every night, so they stay connected Battle/party rock hybrid.

<b>What are some of you fave venues you've performed at?</b>

I’ve had some great experiences playing at Marquee, Cielo, and Pacha in particular.</p><p>Some of my other favorite spots are Studio Square, Public House, and Lexicon.</p><p>For me it's all about the vibe you create in a room.

<b>Tell me a story of your wildest gig.</b>

A little while ago I did a set at Studio Square with “Quiet Events." There was something about the crowd and their energy that night, very different in all my years.</p><p>I’ve never had a room like this; from girls rushing and twerking on the stage to girls jumping on the stage to dance with me.</p><p>The crowd was screaming the words to songs back at me like I’ve never seen -- it was dope.

<b>What is your fave track of 2016 thus far?</b>

"Promise," by &amp;nbsp;Kid Ink ft.</p><p>Fetty Wap.</p><p>The vibe is everything on this record, and I appreciate the message they put forward in the video.

<b>Any last word for the blog?</b>

I’m just incredibly humbled by the experience so far.</p><p>It’s been a wild ride, and I’m grateful to be on it. 2016 has been my best year so far, and I’m very excited for more big things.</p><p>Big shout out to my sponsors Pamplona Unltd, Quiet Events, Onfyre  Managment, and Big Shout to all my Supporters!
