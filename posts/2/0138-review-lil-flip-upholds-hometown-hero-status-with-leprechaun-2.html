  <h1>Review: Lil Flip Upholds Hometown Hero Status With 'Leprechaun 2'</h1>
  <div class="meta">2020-03-30 — reviews</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Though Screwed Up Click alumni Lil Flip (fresh off his recent Drink Champs appearance) may not be mashing up the mainstream these days, he’s far from inactive.</p><p>Case and point, his 17th studio album (and third release of 2020), Leprechaun 2 — a sequel to his 2000 debut that housed the underground hit “I Can Do That.”The 32-song double album begins with “The Old Flip,” which immediately serves to remind listeners why fans gravitated towards the original, which pushed over 200,000 physical copies.</p><p>But this isn’t the old Flip — this is a refined version, 20 years removed from his debut.</p><p>When he delivers music from this perspective, this sequel scores W's.https://youtu.be/ccreDmzXsdk“The Way We Ball, Part 3” starts off with a nod to Notorious B.I.G’s flow on “Notorious Thugs,” referencing his squashed beef with T.I. (“so-called beef with you know who, but we sat down and squashed it fool”). “We Gonna Be Alright” sees him reflecting on his legacy and ageism in Hip Hop.</p><p>Then there’s “Bang My Screw,” a heartfelt tribute DJ Screw and the fallen members of the Screwed Up Click, including 3-2, Big Moe and Big Hawk.https://youtu.be/2mMM3fHVn3wThe bright moments continue across the two-plus hour affair. “Apart Of The Game,” “Texas Tycoon,” and even “Don’t Play Wit Me Gold” offer a combination of straight spitting and retrospective gems.</p><p>However, with 32 songs, there are bound to be a few lulls.</p><p>When Flip makes music that feels too young or laces production that feels a little too dialed back or generic, he loses steam.</p><p>Basic records like “Ca$h App” and “Big Cap” are just two examples.</p><p>Also, throw in one or two cringe-worthy bars here and there — and a few attempts at girl songs.Ultimately, Flip’s career is past the stage of “discovery.” While he may not be in a nationwide commercial prime, he remains an active and revered regional figure.</p><p>This album is geared towards his early and core fans and is at its absolute best when it directly harkens back to its predecessor.</p><p>The 2000 “Soufside Still Holdin',” which clocked in at just over nine minutes, is expanded and evolved with “Southside And Nawfside Still Holdin’,” a twenty-minute cut featuring lots of familiar faces, like S.U.C. members E.S.G., Z-Ro and Lil Keke among others.https://youtu.be/bPXUWUsCCnEIf a 20-minute song (and an album of this length) seems daunting, you likely weren’t a fan of the chopped and screwed phenomenon that birthed Flip — who was once dubbed the freestyle king by DJ Screw himself.</p><p>In fact the sub-genres national anthem of sorts, “June 27,” clocks in a mere seconds shy of 40 minutes in its full OG form.Despite not breaking any molds or producing any larger-than-life singles, Leprechaun 2 keeps the same energy he’s had in recent years and reasserts his legendary status as a hometown hero.</p></div>
