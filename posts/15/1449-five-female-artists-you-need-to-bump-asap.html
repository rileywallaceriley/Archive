  <h1>Five Female Artists You Need To Bump ASAP</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I've been pulling together these weekly playlists, but I wanted to do something different this week.</p><p>I wanted to start a new series for a few weeks to shine some light of the female emcees that have been getting a crazy amount of burn on my iPhone.</p><p>Special shout out to everyone who's been sharing your top picks with me on Twitter -- I see you!</p><p>All five of these ladies should be on your radar -- if they aren't already.

<strong>Suni MF Solomon</strong>

I’ve been showing love to this ATL upstart for a little while now, but she needs a spot on your playlist and way more credit than she’s currently getting, frfr.</p><p>All her music a certain energy about it that just draws me in — I can’t explain it, but if she’s dropping I’m coppin.</p><p>She has a cool look, tons of high-quality videos, and bars (on bars).</p><p>Recommended listening to get you started are “Fake Atlanta Shit” and her remake of Queen Latifah’s “Just Another Day.” Press play.



<strong>Nezi Momodu</strong>

Ok, so when I asked my followers to help me out with the hottest female artists out right now, I legit got about 100 tweets telling me that I’m dumb for not automatically thinking of Nezi Momodu; she’s one part poet, one part singer, and one part cypher ready Emcee.</p><p>Her debut LP seasons is a little of everything, and a super cool cover to cover listen — don’t let the 27-song track-list scare you away.</p><p>Check out one of my fave tracks on the project.



<strong>Mosca Flux</strong>

Mosca Flux is a hustler, real talk.</p><p>She wears many hats as a model, seasoned event host — shit, even a talk show host.</p><p>But, she’s super nice with this Hip Hop music, too.</p><p>The North Carolina-based rapper is savage in a cypher, and has this raw energy about her; you can<a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/flux-with-me-an-interview-with-mosca-flux/"> check out the interview I did with her</a> a while back to learn a little more about what’s she’s all about, and take a look at one of her latest visuals.



<strong>Gavlyn</strong>

Gav is far from underrated, but far from fully appreciated.</p><p>She tours the world dropping bars dripping with that Hip Hop swag the older heads like me grew up on.</p><p>She also has this deep and (slightly) raspy delivery that stands out on top of her impeccable ear for beats.</p><p>She’s a cool, Hip Hop loving weed head that deserves some spins.</p><p>Her catalog is hella nice, too.</p><p>Give her a spin — and check this <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/gavlyn-only-five-feet-tall-rising-high-as-hell/">OG interview I did with her</a>.



<strong>Rico Nasty</strong>

This young DMV artist has so much star potential -- it's nuts.</p><p>I first came across her after she sat down with Genius to chat about her track "Poppin," which surpassed a million spins on Spotify (the place where it matters most).</p><p>I've since been keeping an eye on what she's been up to.</p><p>If you're not up on her, definitely check her out; she's part of that new class that exists on the cusp of going to the next (next) level.</p></div>
