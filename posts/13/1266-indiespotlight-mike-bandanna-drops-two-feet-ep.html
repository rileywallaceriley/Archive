<blockquote>"All I can say is...I put my life into this to share it with you...I do this for you...and I'll keep doing this for as long as you have me..."
—Mike Bandanna</blockquote>
Much like the Weeknd during his epic early rise to internet infamy, rapper Mike Bandanna's image is shrouded in shadowy ambiance -- but that seems to mesh well with his overall sound.</p><p>Sonically Mike sounds like a lost member of the TDE squad, with  aggressive blend of self-conscious bars and soulful, yet dark and bassy, production sensibility he's gravitated towards.</p><p>As he describes on his site, he began his journey two years ago after receiving some advice from a close friend, “If you don’t do it then no one is gonna get it done." As he goes on to describes, "I allowed my creation to be my destination.</p><p>Through this...I find myself at the beginning of a new and the end of old." Along with the  creepy, dark photography, his latest project, <i>Two Feet</i>, when looked at as a cohesive package, comes off as an art project; complete with visual and audio components worthy of a gallery exhibition.</p><p>Across the nine-song EP, he covers an array of topics, painting lush rhyme schemes around concepts of mortality and self-reflective sensibility -- with a dash good old fashioned emcee ego -- to create a well-rounded audio journey.</p><p>His cadence, which almost reminds me slightly of Kendrick in spots, is well complimented by the production of tracks like "Great," dope operatic sample base, the seven-minute "Not Enough/Timeless," or "Fade Away," which was one of my favourite tracks on the project.</p><p>He also blends a rap/singing vibe on the R&amp;B tinged "The Passing," which is also seven minutes in length.</p><p>Mike Bandanna is a combination of many different things that have -- historically -- helped many artists recognize a certain level of success. <i>Two Feet</i> is a solid project that he can definitely  hang his hat on and use to further springboard his brand.</p><p>A worthy addition to your playlist this upcoming week!
