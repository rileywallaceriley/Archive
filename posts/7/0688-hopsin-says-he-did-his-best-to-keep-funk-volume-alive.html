  <div class="content"><p>In the latest installment of Soulful Sundays, HipHopDX's Editor-In-Chief Trent Clark chats with Hopsin over some mouth-watering eats at Comfort LA in downtown Los Angeles.Fresh off his European tour — and four months removed from his first post-Funk Volume LP, No Shame — Hopsin discusses life after the now-defunct label, learning to work with others, his appeal to white audiences and his (brief) cameo in Criminal Minds."I never saw the episode, but I remember when I did it,” Hopsin says of extra work on Criminal Minds. “I made my $100 a day and was out of there ... a lot of my fans have found it, too.”When asked by Clark about him standing out by doing seemingly “non-black rapper things,” Hop laughed it off.“I'm just me ...</p><p>I don't want to be tied down to the idea of what I'm supposed to be or what everybody else is doing,” he notes. “I love cartoons, I love skateboarding, I love drawing, and I love adventures."Hopsin also discussed plans to do a lot more collaborations in 2018, which — for him — is a big deal.“I've been uncomfortable ...</p><p>I couldn't break out of my shell  where I was able to work with people,” he says, noting it’s been holding him back. “I’m learning how to be creative with others.”https://youtu.be/nQV-zvnRlIQWhen it comes to his former label, he’s quick to uphold his integrity in the situation.“I know in my heart that I did the best I could do to keep Funk Volume alive and keep everyone together," he explains. "It sucks the way that it ended.</p><p>I loved  ... it was mine before it was anybody else’s.”He also left open the possibility of a Love & Hip Hop-esque reunion, adding that he’s willing to candidly discuss the situation with everyone involved."They all know what happened,” he says.Watch the full episode of Soulful Sundays above.</p></div>
