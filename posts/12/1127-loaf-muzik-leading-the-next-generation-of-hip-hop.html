  <h1>Loaf Muzik: Leading The Next Generation Of Hip-Hop</h1>

<p class="p1">"It’s the wavelengths, bro, that change over time because nothing stops moving -- including people.</p><p>Niggas get older; new people take their place."</p>
<p class="p1">-- Kidaf</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">The next generation of hip-hop is coming of age as of late, and the future of the genre is bright.</p><p>Not to say there wasn't always youngins in the game, but the industry is a transitional state, and a new breed of artists armed with a true sense of golden era asthetic – and a built in digital marketing compass – are reclaiming the elements that had many of us older heads fall in love with the back in it's hay day.</p><p>Furthermore, these new rappers are seemingly a buffer, allowing some of the older/jaded ears to take in some of the newer influences they may otherwise sleep on.</p><p>There are a number of soldiers leading this brigade, many of whom I've featured here.</p><p>Today, though, I want to introduce Loaf Muzik, a Brooklyn hip-hop collective consisting of members Oso Dope, Kidaf, Shine Sinatra, and Shadow The Great.</p>
<p class="p1">All in their early 20's, these cats are remarkably self-aware, and seem to have found their artistic focus/foundation quite early on.</p><p>With their new mixtape, <i>Live From The Dungeon</i>, their collaborative release with Harry Freud, <i>Camo Assassin</i>, and their work with Team Backpack, their work ethic is showing – and for now, it's all in-house.</p>
<p class="p1">The guys were kind enough to sit down with AAHIPHOP to talk about their music, their influences and more.</p><p>Check out the interview below, and get familiar!</p>

<hr />

<strong><span class="s1">Talk a little bit about first how you got into hip-hop and then we’ll get into Loaf Muzik and how that came together...</span></strong>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>OSO</strong>: I got into hip hop pretty much just opening up my eyes to my surroundings and my neighborhood where I was growing up.</p><p>You know, here in people’s apartments and across the street somebody else had they speaker outside their 7th-floor apartment; hearing people compete for the loudest speaker, facing the window, hearing that soul.</p><p>That bass line, those drums, at the park, on every single corner.</p><p>That’s where my hip-hop experience began, literally just growing up taking a detour around the neighborhood and stuff like that.</p><p>Also, video games that had mad brand new tracks on them.</p><p>I would play the games just to listen and bump the tracks, every word, things like that.</p><p>That’s how I started knowing about different MCs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Shine</strong>: In all truth, it was Shadow, he exposed me to it.</p><p>He showed me everything about it.</p><p>Whether it was the lyricism or DJing or, you know, b-boying, I just started to expand my knowledge about it.</p><p>It just caught my attention; you know what I mean?</p><p>I got put onto like all these artists and at the time, I was like maybe 14 or 15.</p><p>Listening to dudes that grew up in the same city I grew up in.</p><p>Relating to them in a certain type of way because of what they're saying.</p><p>Listening in to them, also to the drums, the bass line, the low end.</p><p>It was just like, so captivating.</p><p>You got all these dope ass lyricists who come from the same area in reality.</p><p>You got Big Pun from Queens, Biggie from Brooklyn and all these dope ass artists – but they're all New York artists.</p><p>It was like, knowing that all these guys grew up in the same city that I'm growing up in—it was crazy.</p><p>Being 14, knowing that.</p><p>It was dope.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Kidaf</strong>: How I fell in love with hip-hop?</p><p>It’s a very particular story, bro.</p><p>My brother had just turned 18; he copped a fucking Lincoln LS, some burgundy shit.</p><p>I went inside, and he was playing a Big L and Jay-Z freestyle.</p><p>It was a 9-minute long freestyle.</p><p>I heard hip hop before but I had never heard nobody kill it like that.</p><p>Ever since I heard that, I just fell in love with the art.</p><p>And then with the art comesthe culture.</p><p>You just feel all these people just doing what they want to do in a world where that’s pretty hard, you know what I'm saying?</p><p>It was attractive to me, even as a young kid.</p><p>Now that I’m older, I still have that same mind state – do it yourself.</p><p>In 2016 everybody got their movement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">So how did you guys come together?</p><p>Did you guys go to the same school?</p><p>How did you guys meet and decide to form Loaf Muzik?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Kidaf</strong>: Through music and school, bro.</p><p>Education is secondary to it, though.</p><p>I knew Shadow in middle school; he was living in Brooklyn.</p><p>It was like a community thing.</p><p>I was living all the way in Queens.</p><p>I was fucking with his shit, he was fucking with mine, and then we linked up – and we started making music together.</p><p>It sounds pretty straightforward, but it was dope the way everything came together.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>OSO</strong>: The simplest form of it was pretty much… I knew Shine from the neighborhood, and I also knew Shadow from the neighborhood.</p><p>It was like "I’m going to rep your shit, you're going to rep my shit," that’s how we started with the music aspect.</p><p>We just started hanging out more, and it became a lifestyle – more of a religion.</p><p>We had started making plans and started evolving more of our homies/crew into what it is now.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p1">"If people say New York hip hop is back, then New York hip hop is back.</p><p>The people are the ones that create these terms..."</p>
<p class="p1">-- Oso Dope</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Is it more of a group or collective?</p><p>Because it’s very specific wording.</p><p>For example, Wu-Tang is a group.</p><p>I guess they’ve grown into a collective, but they're a group.</p><p>Do you guys think about yourselves as separate entities or do you work more as a group?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Kidaf</strong>: Nah, I think it’s like this bro: If we’re all in the same room, it’s a group.</p><p>But the minute I step outside that door, it’s all me.</p><p>We’re all in our shit, and we all have our style you know what I'm saying?</p><p>That’s why the group is so strong.</p><p>I think we’re kind of both, man.</p><p>I think once you start to use words like the group and collective...I mean, we’re brothers; I'm probably going to chill with them later on today, and smoke—you know what I'm saying?</p><p>We’re a family...we’re a family first.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Shine</strong>: It’s like collective creatively.</p><p>The group is like the family.</p><p>We mob together. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>OSO</strong>: Everyone has their shit, yeah.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Kidaf</strong>: Exactly, everyone has their creative niche that just coexists with everyone else.</p><p>That’s the collective part of it.</p><p>One vibration.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">It’s an interesting direction too because if you think about it, collectives don’t break up.</p><p>Groups break up.</p><p>Groups always have trouble, but collectives don’t break up because it’s a different mentality.</p><p>Native tongues is a collective; they're all very strong artists kind of on their own. </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">What are you guys currently working on?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We just dropped a tape called <i><a href="https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS5KzZxZXKAhXD8x4KHWYXALEQFggcMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Floafmuzik.bandcamp.com%2Freleases&amp;usg=AFQjCNFcWwneCmBORiOkOBzU1UHsydotUg&amp;sig2=CsUwHChaeSrFIoM6HUBuOw">Live from the Dungeon</a> </i>that can be found on DatPiff.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>OSO</strong>: We also dropped <i>Camo Assassin </i>like a week or two ago.</p><p>That’s the shit that we just did; we were in the studio for 22 hours with Harry Freud, we came out with that.</p><p>It came out through Red Bull Sound Selects.</p><p>They (Red Bull) put us up on Pandora, too.</p><p>We’re going to keep creating keep giving you guys a taste of Loaf, you know what I'm saying.</p><p>Just more and more.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Kidaf</strong>: A lot of things, a lot of projects following up.</p><p>That’s what people can expect.</p><p>More <em>Live From The Dungeon</em>, more of that experience, more of that insight. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/233489655&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false" width="100%" height="166" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Here’s a question: You guys do a lot independently.</p><p>Do you guys think about maybe going with a label or going major?</p><p>Do you think there’s an advantage?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Kidaf</strong>: Loaf Muzik, it’s a label already.</p><p>That’s how we operate.</p><p>Always had a do-it-yourself mentality.</p><p>When we were all getting together, trying to figure out how we were going to get this shit bigger, it was never like, how are we going to get found?</p><p>It was more like, how are we going to create a foundation of sand, that way we can keep getting bigger to fill more places?</p><p>We don’t have a handout mentality.</p><p>Not to say that anybody getting signed to a label is getting a handout, but in-house is our specialty, and we take a lot of pride in that.</p><p>Getting shit done on our own, and not working <em>for</em> somebody but working <em>with</em> somebody.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Who are some of the artists that you guys look up to?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>OSO</strong>: On the real, I look up to Daf.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Kidaf</strong>: Yeah, to keep it real with you bro, to keep it real, I listen to a lot of rap.</p><p>Regarding artists I look up to, I look up to these guys bro.</p><p>Not even be corny with it.</p><p>I know these people.</p><p>It’s hard for me to sit down and create a character for an artist that I look up to, and want to be like.</p><p>Hip-hop is what we do; you know what I'm saying?</p><p>I'm more inspired by the people around me, how they get down.</p><p>The last thing you want to do is be the wack nigga while your homies are killing it. </span><span class="s1">So yeah, that’s my answer to that bro.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">You guys do have a very 90s sound.</p><p>I'm much older than you guys.</p><p>I'm about 10, 12 years older than you guys.</p><p>You guys sound like the shit I was bumping in high school, which is dope.</p><p>It’s very organic; it doesn’t seem like you're trying to sound like that.</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Kidaf</strong>: People say shit like that all the time, bro.</p><p>Ever since we started, people have been saying that.</p><p>I don’t think that's what we’re going for; I think we’re just going for lyricism.</p><p>That’s how it is in my head.</p><p>Everybody else is filtered; it will go straight to old school hip hop.</p><p>We spit, we do what we like, you know what I'm saying?</p><p>Of course, to a lot of people, it’s going to translate into that.</p><p>That’s just the way life is. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>OSO</strong>: I think it’s a compliment, having them compare us.</p><p>Not compare us, but tell us that we remind them of something that is great.</p><p>I feel like the music from the 90s is great music, it hits home.</p><p>That’s the root of a lot of people’s hip hop introduction.</p><p>To be able to remind people much older than us, it’s a compliment.</p><p>Yo, I remind you of a great time?</p><p>That’s what’s up!</p><p>We remind you of great music?</p><p>Thank you, it’s an honor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Shine</strong>: Whenever people say that it’s a compliment.</p><p>To me, music from the 90s is very much timeless.</p><p>So when people say we remind them of that sound, It’s like saying we have a timeless sound.</p><p>That’s very much what music should be; music should be timeless.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">http://youtu.be/v3cfFMMLO2o</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">People seem to be the most connected to a certain period of music in their lives, you know what I'm saying.</p><p>It’s like in the Tribe song, was it <i>Excursions</i>?</p><p>When Q-Tip’s dad was saying that hip hop reminded him of bebop.</p><p>That’s what he listened to when he was a kid. </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>OSO</strong>: That shit was dope, bebop, it’s a compliment.</p><p>I feel like every music has a  root, it comes from somewhere.</p><p>I feel like the further you go back in music, the greater it makes you feel based on the vibrations.</p><p>To remind someone of those good vibrations is a good feeling because that’s what we want to do.</p><p>We want to transcend good vibrations and positivity when we do our art, do our lyricism, do our beats, do our visuals, do our shows, do all that. </span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p1">"To me, music from the 90s is very much timeless.</p><p>So when people say we remind them of that sound, It’s like saying we have a timeless sound."</p>
<p class="p1">-- Shine Sinatra</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">How important is it for you guys to stay true to where you're from as New York cats?</p><p>Because when I listen to you guys, it sounds like a resurgence of New York hip hop.</p><p>It sounds like New York is coming back.</p><p>Hip-hop went through many stages, and it went through damn near every region in the United States of America in the last 20 years. </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Shine</strong>: If people say New York hip hop, is back then I guess they should say "hip hop" is back – and that’s dope.</p><p>In a conventional sense, it’s back, but it never left.</p><p>It’s in the streets.</p><p>It’s a lifestyle, and you just don’t drop a lifestyle.</p><p>As long as people who live that lifestyle are still breathing, then it’s still alive. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">I feel like maybe eight years ago you guys would’ve been as buzzing.</p><p>The sound was very, very different.</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Shine</strong>: People are always going just to try to put things in categories…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Kidaf</strong>: One style can make other styles obsolete if enough people fuck with it.</p><p>Think about it.</p><p>It’s like alright cool, somebody is rapping about diamonds, and mad niggas is fucking with diamonds.</p><p>But then, some nigga comes out of nowhere from the gutter in the Bronx, or some shit, and says, "we don’t give a fuck about nothing, and the niggas are on the fucking street." It'll be like, fuck diamonds bro, we’re hitting the streets, this shit is hot now.</p><p>It’s not even about the style.</p><p>It’s the wavelengths, bro, that changes over time because nothing stops moving including people.</p><p>Niggas get older; new people take their place.</p><p>New shit.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>OSO</strong>: If people say New York hip hop is back, then New York hip hop is back.</p><p>The people are the ones that create these terms and like Daf said, these wavelengths.</p><p>They're like the critics; they're the perspective.</p><p>So it’s like, they receive what we create.</p><p>So whatever they see is how they feel about it.</p><p>That's technically how it goes, you know. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Where do you guys see Loaf Muzik going?</p><p>What’s your ultimate goal?</p><p>It might be a hard question.</p><p>What’s your goal?</p><p>What do you guys want to be 30 years from now when people are looking back?</p><p>What do you want people to remember about Loaf Muzik?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Kidaf</strong>: Our creations – everything we expose as artists.</p><p>We want to be remembered as what we do, what we create, what we put out.</p><p>It's just crazy because we all have mad shit, mad goals, and when we come together, it just multiplies.</p><p>I just want to Influence others, really, just to continue to vibrate on this frequency with us, to spread positivity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Shine</strong>: Maybe some nigga that we don’t even know, from some other part of the world somewhere is going to get up and change his whole life just because he heard a track and got inspired.</p><p>That is contagious.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>OSO</strong>: No more of that hating, people.</p><p>It's about unity.</p><p>It’s real; that’s what it comes down to.</p><p>That’s where hip-hop started, people coming together.</p><p>I feel like we have the platforms to make it happen, so that’s what we gon’ do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Shine</strong>: Make some dope ass music, travel the world and shit.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Kidaf</strong>: Yeah, pretty much.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">You guys have any last words, any last shout outs? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>OSO</strong>: Thanks for the interview man.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Kidaf</strong>: Shout out to AboveAverageHipHop.com, thanks for having us, yo. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Shine</strong>: You should check out Camo Assasins when you get the chance. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Kidaf</strong>: You know what I'm saying, high new hip hop!</p><p>Shout out to my man, shout out to Captain Mark… mad dope visuals, new films, just stay in the fucking loop with us.</p><p>Keep out, keep watch, Brooklyn, Queens, all that shit universal. </span></p>
