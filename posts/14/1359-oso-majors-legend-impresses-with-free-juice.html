Illinois rapper Legend—the face of Oso Major Entertainment—has dropped more than one banging loosies over the past quarter; this week, though, he hit us off with a more substantial helping of freshness. <em>Free Juice</em>, a focused seven-song freebie has a little of everything, but above all, it's a healthy dose of bars and fire production.
<p style="text-align: left;">Legend swerves into a few lanes as the filler-less project progresses.</p><p>He Kicks off with a 'freestyle' of sorts on 2Pac's classic "Mind Made Up" off of his multi-platinum-selling <em>All Eyez On Me</em>, which happens to be the first CD Legend ever purchased.</p><p>He sets the tone with a barrage of impressive wordplay, "young Legend spit bullets every conversation." On "C-O-N" he addresses the mindset of the average trapper engulfed in a reality of slanging or starving.</p>
He channels a more melodic side on records like "Please Don't Turn It Up," and the slow and sexy "Guilty Pleasures," but he doesn't let the vibe ever settle.</p><p>With records like the almost dip-set sounding production of "I'm Here" and the searing, subliminal punchline fest "Round 1" in play, the record walks the line without ever getting soft, boring, or stale.</p><p>The record "MIA" is a letter to a friend locked up, and one of the standouts of the project.</p><p>With it's slow, cinematic flow, Legend reminisces on the better times.</p><p>Free Juice paints a picture of a hustler gone straight.</p><p>Whether or not the overt street-isms are factual or just bars, it's clear that his heart ships and struggles have found a way to permeate itself into his music.</p><p>With obvious mainstream hip-hop appeal, <em>Free Juice</em> is an entertaining prelude to an exciting artist who you want to keep on your watch list for 2017.
