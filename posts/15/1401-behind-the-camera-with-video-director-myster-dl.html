  <h1>Behind The Camera With Video Director Myster DL</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>We're in the age of the music video, and few video directors have been as trusted by real heads as Myster DL.</p><p>Creeping up on his 250th video, he's worked with acts like Redman, Sean Price, Styles P, Chuck D, Cormega, and more.</p><p>That's on top of film/TV, and commercial work that's helped make ILL Mannered Films such a bankable brand in the game.</p><p>His demo reel speaks for itself.</p><p>The 36-year-old director recently sat with AAHH for an exclusive interview, fresh off of the release of his latest video for Kool G Rap, “Running.”

<strong>How did you get involved in directing videos?
</strong>
In the height of my music career, I started doing music videos in 2011.</p><p>I always had an eye for photos, and I took a video editing course in college but only to fulfill course requirements.</p><p>I took to it instantly and got a 100% as a grade.</p><p>This did not inspire my career it's just a fun fact.</p><p>About seven years after that I was on set for a music video, and the director didn’t show up, so I said to the artist “give me the camera I’ll shoot it.” Everyone had a chuckle, and I filmed it, edited on iMovie in a few hours and we put it out.</p><p>It took off right away.</p><p>About ten videos later I was shooting videos for Sean Price, Cormega, Sticky Fingaz and more.</p><p>When I say right away, I mean it.</p><p>My film career took off quick because I already had a name and had made so many legendary connections during my music career it was easy to approach artists because I had already produced records for most of them.

<strong>Who was someone you looked up to when getting into the game?
</strong>
My all time biggest influence was and is Cypress Hill.</p><p>Without Cypress Hill, I doubt there would be a Myster DL.</p><p>I might be someone completely different.</p><p>I always enjoyed Hip Hop, but Cypress Hill’s Black Sunday album made me want to create it.</p><p>The music eventually turned into making music videos which turned into making films.</p><p>Cypress Hill appeared in my 1st film, and I consider them friends and peers.</p><p>Eric Bobo and I have a few projects, and B-Real is on my next album.

<strong>What have been career highlights for you?
</strong>
My highlight was defiantly my 1st film A Sea of Green.</p><p>I spent three years working on that movie.</p><p>I wrote, directed, filmed, edit, produced and even acted in it and it features a slew of legendary rappers.</p><p>Another moment that comes to mind is my mom seeing my name on HBO and of course directing videos for iconic MCs like Sean Price, Chuck D, LOX, and Redman.

<strong>Tell me about the concept for your latest visual for Kool G Rap.
</strong>
I filmed three videos that day.</p><p>It was a 19-hour ordeal, 10 of which was traveling back and forth.</p><p>We did videos for songs with Kool G Rap, Freeway, Lil Fame, Term &amp; Saigon.</p><p>The “Running” video was supposed to come out 2nd, but things got moved around, and we went with “Running” 1st.</p><p>I knew instantly I would incorporate running into the video.</p><p>I didn’t want the video to be a too gangster because the 1st video we shot was a gangster movie set to a beat with all the rappers acting.</p><p>So for “Running” I wanted to tell a story using bits and pieces of the MCs lyrics and manipulating it into a story about struggle.

<strong>Do you have any crazy on-set stories (from any shoots)?
</strong>
I have a lot but will try not be incriminating.</p><p>I've been on set with some big rappers that were mostly cool and some that we had to put in their place.</p><p>One of my most memorable on-set memories was Chuck D driving me through Brooklyn telling me stories about the early days of Hip Hop and how he helped Ice Cube deal with his fame.</p><p>I rarely pose for pictures, but I took a few that day.</p><p>On the set of the Kool G Rap “Wiseguys” video, the NYPD took control of my drone and crashed it because we must have been in a restricted no fly zone.</p><p>I was arrested in Brownsville, Brooklyn shooting a video for Rock of Heltah Skeltah and was locked up in the 73rd (peep my Words) for a few days over a half ounce of weed.</p><p>When I got out I called Rock and said “hey man sorry I got arrested, ” and he said “no sh*t.” It took us years to finally do that video.</p><p>Multiple film sets have had the police gearing up ready to take us down because they got so many calls of people brandishing guns.</p><p>In our defense, they were props -- mostly.

<strong>What advice do you have for up and coming directors?
</strong>
Put out quality work and brand yourself.</p><p>Start and end every video with your logo or info.</p><p>All my videos start with my ILL Mannered Films logo, and if you don’t want it to start that way, there is a lot of other good directors you can get.</p><p>In an age where everything is visual, and blogs are sustained by videos, I’m surprised they rarely credit directors.</p><p>By the way, this goes for nonfamous producers also.</p><p>The rapper gets all the credit for the concepts and the quality of the videos.</p><p>This has happened to me countless time.</p><p>You know what the rapper does?</p><p>Raps.</p><p>Sometimes not even that as a lot don’t know their rhymes and the director has to make the viewer not realize that.</p><p>These blogs aren’t going to give you your credit so give it to yourself.</p><p>I've done 235 music videos, and sometimes blogs still leave my name out.

<strong>What do you have coming up?
</strong>
I have an ongoing documentary web series that is currently out called “Rewind The Scenes” where I look back at some of my biggest videos and go in depth on how we made them.</p><p>I have episodes for over 30 legendary acts so far.</p><p>I have a 10 episode comedy TV show coming out soon called The Weekend Warriors, which is wild and also features so hip hop heavyweights in some hilarious situations.</p><p>I am also beginning production on my 2nd full-length film.</p><p>It is an urban crime drama called As Thick As Thieves, and of course I am approaching my 250th video.</p><p>Who will it be?</p></div>
