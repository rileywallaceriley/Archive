—Siimba Liives Long</blockquote>
After a strong debut with his "Cocaine Bimbie" song/visual ten months ago and two highly praised sold-out shows in New York City -- one of which resulted in an impromptu fire eating performance after the venue shut down -- Siimba Liives Long returns with a jazzy new record and a larger than life new video.</p><p>It's simultaneously entertaining and oddly endearing.</p><p>With an African backdrop  Siimba is seen interacting with a number wild cats, from gorgeous lions to a cuddly looking cheetah, with whom he dances, plays in the grass, and even does push-ups.</p><p>While not wholly varied in its shots, the video is mesmerising and easy to get lost in.</p><p>The song itself, "W.I.A," is a subtle and well-versed attack on the BS that seems to run rampant in the music industry.</p><p>From the Afu-Ra-esque look, and the incredible production that -- quite frankly -- innovates by sticking to the basics, Siimba quickly sets himself apart from other rappers on your playlist right now.</p><p>To top it off, he has bars; like, for days. "I used to not smoke but now I'm feeling like I need that, cuz all my people stay up on the joint like a knee cap."

If you're not up on Siimba yet, peep out coverage of his first single, and his first NYC gig. "If you don't know, now you know ."
