  <div class="content"><p>Fuck it, we're biased!</p><p>There, I said it.</p><p>When we like an artist here at AAHIPHOP, we hold them down to the fullest.</p><p>That's something we're going to continue to do for the homie Koncept – rapper, closet DJ, and Fat Beats alumni.</p><p>He just dropped a super fun new visual off of the must-listen collaboration project with J57, <i>The Fuel EP</i>.</p><p>It originally premiered on Fader earlier this week – and we were stoked when he reached out to us with it. <i>The Excitement </i>– featuring Andrew Thomas Reid – is a drunken ride along that takes us everywhere from cabs to Fader's office.</p><p>It was shot entirely by the guys themselves around New York City using Go-Pro cameras, and was edited by fellow Brooklyn-ite, director <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Qvestoverus">Jawney Quest</a>.</p><p>If you haven't already, stream the whole EP below. <i>The Flight LP</i> is dropping in 2016, so stay tuned for that.</p><p>As well, be sure to check out <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/the-fuel-a-conversation-with-rapper-koncept/">our interview with Koncept.</a>
