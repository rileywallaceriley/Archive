  <h1>Review: Young Trap’s “Hustle & Glow” Fits In But Doesn’t Stand Out</h1>
  <div class="meta">2019-07-27 — reviews</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Something is intriguing about Memphis rapper Young Trap.</p><p>Across his brand new 11-song LP, Hustle & Glow, he shows a lot of different versions of himself that (all at once) make him stand out and blend in.</p><p>Having been relatively quiet since the release of the third installment of his Debonaire Music series — which dropped in 2013 — he’s been making some noise with the off-kilter fire single “On My Belt” as well as “Too Much Sauce.” Though he’s wrangled some high-profile features for this project, there is a lack of consistency that keeps it from reaching its full potential.https://youtu.be/BnuFChKU5PQThere is an unspoken sense of authenticity that oozes through Young Trap’s ability use a very familiar at times harmonious flow that manages to come through with a hint of originality at the hands of his refreshing cadence.</p><p>This project is well-produced — and the curation has allowed him to sparkle on everything he touches.</p><p>Where it gets a little monotonous is the subject matter; at it’s best, Trap wears his heart on his sleeve. “Love On You” featuring Kyle Sterling is a surprisingly out of place record low-key professing rekindled love for a high-school crush that got away. https://open.spotify.com/track/7rQUUSv0mPbpF5CjXCjglu?si=4i_lFTf1TgWkqTq2LpuqiQWhat makes it stick out, are songs like “I’m a Dog” — an almost generic attempt at flossing his ability to smash O.P.P. Oddly, “My Ex” and even the Bay Area slapper “Fuck Love” featuring Too $hort seems to create this sense that he’s been hurt and isn’t about to make the same mistake again. “Get Scooped” is another standout; though he puts on his playboy hat during the second verse, it’s the first verse that again seems to paint the opposite picture — saying he’s going to make a child with the young woman he’s bedding.https://open.spotify.com/track/4KJ9JvjJwEGYQHLYFlSFD5?si=8lwpa0apRe2lDImStzcTAwInterestingly, alternate sequencing could almost tell a love story, though it’s evident that not what he’s trying to do.</p><p>Making it clear where he’s from and what he’s repping on the Boosie Badazz assisted “For The Hood,” he’s not about to get too in his feelings.</p><p>Playing out more as a playlist than a cohesive body of work, he never gets too street as to create music that couldn’t easily fit into any notable playlist.</p><p>Hustle & Glow is by no means a masterpiece begging for multiple listens and interpretations, as it’s quite straightforward in that sense.</p><p>There are more than a few reasons to love it though, and although Young Trap doesn’t quite make a case for next-level stardom, he more than deserves a spot on the radar.https://youtu.be/IxRIudo-Djw</p></div>
