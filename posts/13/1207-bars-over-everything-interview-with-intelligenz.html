– Intelligenz</blockquote>
When it comes to contemporary hip-hop, there seems to be a definitive blueprint that's been etched out for a sea of artists to follow.</p><p>This is particularly the case for female artists.</p><p>Luckily, though, we have a handful of femcees -- or rather emcees -- cut from the cloth of pioneers like Mc Lyte, who put bars over everything.</p><p>The lovely, and talented, Intelligenz, is one such artist.</p><p>Are you type that needs a cosign to subscribe to an artist?</p><p>She was the winner of MC Lyte’s Next Top Female MC Competition after driving from Las Vegas to LA to battle against Femcees from all over the country.</p><p>Also, she's the first female artist signed to HiPNOTT Records, founded by  Kevin Nottingham.</p><p>That's a great start.</p><p>She was approached by the label after reps saw her open for the Ruler Slick Rick.</p><p>Until now, we've only had a handful of  singles to go off, but she's currently working on her debut album, which should see the light of day soon.</p><p>She recently sat with us here at AAHIPHOP to chat about her music, her career, obstacles female emcees face, and ageism in the game.</p><p>Get to know Intelligenz!

Tell me a little bit about yourself -- and how you got into music.</p><p>I'd say the most significant value to me is my faith, then my family; they're vital to me .</p><p>I got into music as a child; writing was kind of like my outlet.</p><p>I started writing poetry and tapping into myself.</p><p>I also used to draw and play with the keyboard a little bit.</p><p>When I got to high school there were people in there rapping around my sophomore, and I was like, "Oh, that's easy."

And so we'd have little competitions, and instead of a 16, I'd come with like a 32 .</p><p>But, everybody had such a positive reaction.</p><p>I had already been writing for years, but it was the first time I merged that with the beat -- and I just fell in love ever since.</p><p>That was it.</p><p>It was almost to a point where when I did write poetry I couldn't have music on because I couldn't detach from the rhythm.</p><p>Tell me a little bit about the projects you've done so far.</p><p>I’ve just been putting out singles.</p><p>I started late -- like 27 -- to get out there because I battled stage fright.</p><p>So I spent the first couple of years just really trying to push a single called "If You Ever Doubt It," get over stage fright, and just try to have a presence and connect with people.</p><p>To be honest, at that time I was seeking validation for my talent.</p><p>I mean, I'm talented but just to know if I believe in myself enough like that.</p><p>And so I was getting ready to release my album, and I learned so much more about copyright law and realized that everything that I had I couldn't release.</p><p>So I have projects that are unreleased. "I'm a Movement," though, is my baby -- and the first song that I ever put on iTunes.</p><p>It (really) introduced my story, paid homage to Nas and how I look to him as a mentor from a distance, and also spoke about the actions of female hip-hop artists in the game.</p><p>Also, at the time, I was married, and I wanted to pay honor and tribute to my husband because he was my number one supporter.</p><p>So there were a lot of tributes on that album.</p><p>Also, I was hoping that people kind of pick up on me lyrically and my ability to construct a song as well from a writing perspective.

<strong>What are you working on now?</strong>

Right now I'm working on Everything I Am, which is going to be my debut album, which will be released under HiPNOTT.</p><p>So that's important to me.</p><p>I'm looking at potentially doing an EP to put out just to get some movement on the album before it drops, so I can give heads something to expect.</p><p>I can tell you the goal of my album, which a lot of people aren't going to know, is that I don't want features on it.</p><p>All the writing will be done by me, including any singing parts.</p><p>There won't be anything except for maybe a singer.</p><p>When it comes to rapping, I will be the only emcee that's on the album.</p><p>I don't want to feel like that a beat has to carry me or another male emcee has to carry me.</p><p>I want to stand on my own.</p><p>So it will be a statement piece.

<strong>Do you feel that, as a female emcee, there are more obstacles to getting into the industry?</strong>

I'd say to be recognized as a solidified emcee, yes -- and I think there was a point in time where we could blame it on the males.</p><p>But, I believe that now the blueprint is to put on stilettos and the closest pair of leggings.</p><p>And that's the problem.</p><p>We're focusing more on imagery than we are on the talent.</p><p>So as far as pressure, I don't even feel the pressure from people go hard.</p><p>Nobody cares about that; nobody cares about quality or consciousness.</p><p>But, I don't think that there's pressure on any females to be lyrical.</p><p>I don't think anyone looks for us to be lyrical anymore.</p><p>They look for sex appeal.</p><p>So if there's any pressure I feel that I have, it's the pressure to deliver something that can captivate the minds that have already been molded only to expect sexualized content from me.</p><p>There's pressure to see how can I penetrate those minds and make them appreciate music -- quality music

<strong>Who have been some of your influences?</strong>

Nas number one.</p><p>I feel like almost anything I write, I think if he  was in front of me, would I spit that for him?</p><p>Then, Lauren Hill is everything to me.</p><p>She's the perfect combination of artistry, consciousness, risk taker, authenticity.</p><p>Then artists like Jean Gray (who's incredible of course) and Mc Lyte -- she's opened so many doors for us queens.</p><p>Just people more so on the lyrical side, though.

<strong>What would you say is your goal in this industry?</strong>

My goal is to break the barrier.</p><p>My goal is to be challenged; my goal is to give back to hip-hop what it gave it to me.</p><p>Some songs impacted me and changed my life; some songs prevented me from mistakes, and there are songs that gave me encouragement.</p><p>Some songs kept me out of the club as opposed to the ones that are only putting people in there.</p><p>My goal is to give them diversity again; to make people hungry to step in the ring again -- especially for women to give the other side.</p><p>Today, it's almost like the only way that we define women as breaking barriers and being totally free is to be completely naked.</p><p>We forgot about the power of being a minimalist and being in the forefront.</p><p>I'm kind of tired of not seeing that other representation.</p><p>If you don't want me to judge the other side for being revealing, then don't judge me for being less revealing.</p><p>Let's just get back to the talent.</p><p>My goal is to say "it's never too late, we've got to follow our dreams." My goal is to break the stigma of how we age in the industry.</p><p>Maya Angelou was able to do poetry until she died, but when you put a beat behind it and call it hip hop, all of a sudden when I hit a certain age I'm no longer authorized to be able to follow that same path.</p><p>So I'm just trying to uplift people who feel like maybe they're at a certain point in their life where they think, "Oh, I didn't do it by this age.</p><p>That's too late." Says who?</p><p>We're living longer than we ever have.</p><p>It's never too late!
