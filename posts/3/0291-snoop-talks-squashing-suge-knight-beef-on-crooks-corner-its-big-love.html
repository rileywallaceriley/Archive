  <div class="content"><p>It's no secret the relationship between former Death Row Records CEO Suge Knight and West Coast rap icon Snoop Dogg was as rocky as it gets.</p><p>At the height of their very public tension, Knight even put money on the Doggfather’s head — but as Snoop has long noted, it’s water under the bridge.“Hey man, I’m from the West Coast," he said in an interview with The Breakfast Club. "It comes with the rules and regulations of the game.</p><p>I knew the job was dangerous when I took it."In the latest episode of Crook’s Corner, KXNG Crooked stopped by the studio to chat with Snoop as he prepares the release 17th studio album, I Wanna Thank Me.https://youtu.be/7ehy1-6IuCgIn a clip from the episode, Snoop breaks down his relationship with his former boss and shares a snippet of a new song that he says puts it all in perspective.“I want to showcase the positive side.</p><p>Like, niggas being CEOs, having their own shit and being able to do  thing,” Snoop said, acknowledging that most people choose to dwell on the negative when it comes to Knight.“He showed n-ggas a different mentality, that you can be the owner — you could be a boss.</p><p>You got to highlight that ... they ain't never going to highlight it.</p><p>They'll take credit for that too,” he explains.Snoop — reiterating that he understood the situation at the time —insists it’s “big love,” and says that they’re tighter than ever.“I ain't never hated him.</p><p>You know, that they really tried to do whatever they tried to do to me ... , I don't have that in me, that ain't in my system.”The song, which has yet to be heard in its entirety, is one that Snoop says will put it all out there. “That's what the beauty of it is; I can express that .</p><p>He already knows, but now the world will know.”Suge Knight pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter in a fatal 2015 hit-and-run in September 2018 — and was subsequently sentenced to 28 years in prison.Watch the clip from Crook’s Corner above.https://youtu.be/JMOeDKiVWjM</p></div>
