  <h1>Honor Flow Productions' Latest Drops From 'The B.L.A.C.K. Odyssey' Are Like Chicken Soup For The Soul (For 90s Heads)</h1>

<p>Perhaps it's my age or just the sheer nostalgia I feel for smooth, breezy West Coast vibes, but Honor Flow Productions always come through for me—especially after a tough week.</p><p>Dipped in a deliciously 90s aesthetic, DJ Chuck, ELIMN8, and DJisLORD hit me up with a pair of joints: a single from their (still fresh) 2018 release, <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3G9Pbfl0dOAPnoUFcC9pDs">The B.L.A.C.K. Odyssey </a></em>("It's All Love") and a b-side from the same album, recently unearthed from the original sessions.</p>

<p>Produced by Chuck, "It's All Love" is particularly intriguing in its relatability.</p><p>He sets things off, lamenting his catholic school experience, dubbing hip-hop off the radio (an OCD affection I also shared), and living life in a daze of childhood innocence.</p><p>ELIMN8 recalls overcoming speech therapy and partial deafness as a child to earning a college degree as a byproduct of those who lifted him. </p>

<p>The song is accompanied by a GreenGreeem-directed visual that captures the feel perfectly, from the deliciously west-coast scenery and light leaks to the moving backdrop cutaways reminiscent of Dj Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince's "Summertime" scenes on the moving truck.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While "It's All Love" feels like an afternoon smoke session where you reminisce on yesteryear with your homies, the lost b-side "Cruise Control" feels like later that night, with the two MCs going back and forth about after-hours movements through the city of angels.</p><p>Being the guys they are, that means Galaga &amp; brew with a shorty, streaming Street Fighter, eating tacos, and just, for lack of an unnecessarily deep explanation, enjoying a relatably typical night.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Chuck crushes this instrumental, as well, from top to bottom (which includes cuts by LORD).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's all very refreshing, to be honest; I've always found them appealing for this very reason.</p><p>In a contemporary space that thrives off of gimmicks, bravado, and a whole lot of "gang gang" shit, this type of aura feels like a lost relic: cats that love the spirit of hip-hop making that laid back Cali-boom bap long lost in the shuffle.</p><p>It sounds made for live performance—which isn't a mistake.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hip-hop is more than what it's become commercially and more than its sonic opposite: a more aggressively conscious brand of socio-political movement anthems.</p>

<p>Honor Flow Productions takes me back to sitting outside with my crew on Friday and Saturday night, getting lifted, and making pause tapes off college radio.</p><p>You can feel the purity dripping off of these guys, and after the month I've been through, cruising the city with the windows down bumping this two-pack was medicine for the soul.</p>
