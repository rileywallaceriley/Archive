    <div class="content"><p>After posting an image without his grills back in 2017 -- with a caption suggesting that he intended to remove tattoos on his face -- it appears that Birdman still intends to clean up his image. He told Wendy Williams during a Friday (March 29) appearance on her show that he recently consulted his friend 50 Cent for advice on having the procedure(s) done.“I didn’t want to take the head tattoos off, but I want to take the facials off,” the Cash Money head honcho told Williams (. “I was asking my partner, 50 Cent ’cause he removed his tattoos ... I wanted to go to somebody who can take these tats off my face.”He added, “If I have to live with it, I will.</p>
<p>I just felt like, me being older, I would like to get it off. But if not, it is what it is.In a February 28 interview with Forbes Magazine, Birdman also talked about his desire to remove some of his tats, citing its adverse effect at his age.“I just think at this point in my life, I don't need that,” he explains. “That stereotypes you.</p>
<p>It takes away from the business and certain things.”Check out the full interview, above.[apple_news_ad type="standard”]</p></div>
