  <h1>Cruisin': AAHH Chats With Jersey Rapper DollasignDunn</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Dolla$ignDunn is a New Jersey rapper that we've featured here on AAHH before.</p><p>But — to get deeper — he's an artist that I've been following for a while.</p><p>From the actual onset of our website, he's been steadily feeding us emails (politely) asking us to check out his latest music.</p><p>To be transparent, it wasn't until more recently that I started to not only notice him and his team more — as they're having a great run on the local/indie circuit — but also feel a little slow for sleeping on him.</p><p>I decided to reach out to Dunn to chat about his career — and what he has in the cannon.</p><p>Check out the Q&amp;A below!

<b>What's been a highlight of 2017 for you so far?</p><p>The squad seems to be on a good run.</b>

It's hard to pinpoint one highlight, it been a good year all around (and it's only June).</p><p>But, I would say the on-going support and connecting to people is probably the best thing to happen this year.

<b>How did you get into this game?</b>

Around like 12-13 I would rewrite my favorite songs and revise them.</p><p>So, I learned how to structure songs way before I even thought about rapping.</p><p>I would make freestyle videos with my homie in high school and saw people reacting to them well.</p><p>Fast forward a few years later; my brother had started a label that I was always a supporter of, and I got involved musically around 2014.</p><p>Since then I've been moving!

<b>Who did you look to as and influence early on?</b>

Cam'ron, Ma$e, and Allen Iverson.</p><p>Cam'ron's innovative style — and the way he approached music with a "you gonna hear what I gotta say" type of attitude — is the same way I move.</p><p>Ma$e had this smooth as a breeze kind of aura in his early Bad Boy days that many people say I possess.</p><p>AI was a superhero to me growing up.</p><p>To me, the way he finessed the NBA, doing things his way, is the same way I live my life.

<b>Let's talk about your new joint "Cruisin'."</b>

This record is my favorite joint at the moment.</p><p>I recorded it on new years and just knew it was one of those songs that people will f*ck with.</p><p>I performed it a couple of times and had every venue rocking once this went off.</p><p>Unlike  my other music this shows my fun side — the Dolla$ignDunn that people see when they meet me face to face.

<b>What are you working on?</b>

As of now I'm just building my catalog and helping shape the UpperClass brand.</p><p>I have a few more records ready to drop before the summer's over.</p><p>May or may not have a project dropping shortly; who knows?

<b>What's your goal in this game?</b>

I'm more focused on connecting with the people directly rather than getting attention from folks in the industry.</p><p>I'm a firm believer in cutting out the middle man so as much as I can do on my own I'm gonna do it.</p><p>I'm focused on creating an everlasting wave that'll carry my name as well as the UC brand.

<b>What coming up?</b>

I have a lot of things up my sleeve — always three steps ahead.</p><p>With that being said, be on the look-out for more content from my camp and me.
