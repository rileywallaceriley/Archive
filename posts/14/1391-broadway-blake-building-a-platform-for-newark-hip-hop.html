  <h1>Broadway Blake: Building A Platform For Newark Hip Hop</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Most heads with any sort of hand or ear to the Jersey scene has heard of Broadway Blake.</p><p>Born and raised in one of Newark’s toughest neighborhoods, Blake -- like many of his peers -- needed all the inspiration he could find.</p><p>Luckily hip hop was the escape that provided him that.</p><p>He came in the game with a strong mixtape run, followed by a solid indie release, Broadway Empire.</p><p>He's currently to work towards Broadway Empire 2 while contributing as a member of the buzz worthy <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/vibes-in-the-city-interview-with-jersey-supergroup-lifecrew/">LiFECREW collective</a>.

More notably, though, Blake has transcended the everyday hustle and worked to develop a platform for talent to connect and be heard -- offline.</p><p>Vibes In The City held weekly in the heart of Newark, has become a successful series, thus far running for over year.

"I started Vibes In The City because I felt like there was so much talent in Jersey, but not enough opportunities," says Blake. "There's not enough outlets and platforms where the artist can build and network on a regular basis." As an artist himself, he understands the frustration of having to go "out of town" to feel like your moving your career forward -- especially when you have to consider travel and living expenses. "It's a lot of money for starving artists to get a foot in the door." He initially wanted to build something locally; something that artists felt like they were getting value from by building their network and fan base.

"I also thought it would be perfect for us to have a home where we can practice our craft -- even if it was just once a week," Blake also notes. "Luckily, I've been able to build it with people who have a similar vision for it as me.</p><p>For a long time Jersey had a stigma of not wanting to support our own, so we wanted to be one of the outlets that broke that wall down.</p><p>I had the idea for Vibes In The City in my notebook for at least 5-6 years, and I would always go back to it and tweak things based on other events I would attend."

Once Blake found the perfect location, everything fell into place, and Vibes In The City was born on January 6th, 2016.</p><p>Since then it has become a "haven" for artists in the community.</p><p>However, it beginning to branch out further than even Blake had initially imagined; "through our social media presence, we have been able to attract artists from all over the world -- including Brazil, Miami, Milwaukee, Philly ... that's just to name a few."

"To date, we have been going 70 consecutive weeks, and every day we think of ways to evolve it make it more beneficial for artists, fans and our independent scene as a whole." What started as a goal to have a weekly hub is always evolving in concept, and Blake and his co-founders have lofty goals for its future. "Why not Coachella?</p><p>Why not Afropunk Fest?</p><p>Why not Made In America or SXSW?</p><p>Of course, we're talking about five maybe even 10+ years from now -- but why not think as big as possible?</p><p>Thanks to the endless amounts of talents and creative minds we've been able to meet through Vibes In The City, the plans are unlimited."

If you're in the Tri-State, drop by Vibes In The City any -- or every -- Wednesday; if you're an artist, get at Blake and be a part of</p></div>
