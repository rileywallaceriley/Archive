While Miguel was promoting his third studio album, Wildheart, he did so with an Instagram post of him and DJ Premier in the studio together; that track, though, didn't appear in its original iteration on his  Grammy-nominated album.</p><p>Today, we not only get answers and closure, but fans received a pleasant surprise with the official release of the track!

“The snippet you heard on Miguel’s Instagram, mine is the original” declared DJ Premier, who is also an executive producer for VH1’s “The Breaks” series.&amp;nbsp;"Miguel and I were vibing at a session and just really seeing what we could come up with.&amp;nbsp;What we came up with was dope, but a rough version of what you hear today.&amp;nbsp;Miguel and I had deadlines, and we never got around to finishing it.</p><p>We both believed in this version of the track, and we both felt very strongly that it needed to come out and be released as a single.</p><p>Miguel and I approached the label about releasing it, and everyone was onboard," Premier clarified.</p><p>Entitled “2 LOVIN U,” this is the first release from Premier’s new imprint TTT (To The Top) and is now available worldwide.&amp;nbsp;
