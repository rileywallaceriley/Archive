  <h1>On My Radar: BillboardBaby Is The Future</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sat, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>

<p>Sometimes the industry is just that, an industry — a business drenched by politics beyond the control of the actual talent bound by its residual effects.</p><p>Plenty of great artists fall victim.&amp;nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Look at <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.55006/title.second-wind-grafh-talks-the-oracle-3-recalls-failed-roc-a-fella-deal">Grafh</a>; though he was one of the most talented spitters in New York City during the Mecca's post-millennium mixtape run, politics kept him on the verge instead of in the spotlight like some of his peers (who he could, frankly, rap circles around).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Harlem artist BillboardBaby, formerly known as It’s Ya Girl Nicolette, is also one of those artists dripping in allure; I first got onto her via a freestyle on Power 105.</p><p>I went down the rabbit hole from there, and after literal months of DMing, we hopped on a call and — honestly — her story is even more intriguing than I previously thought … I promise that you'll just as plugged in as I am now by the end of this.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nicolette got her start early on as a member of The Harlem Sunshine Girls — a group founded by her mother that included her late sister, Olivia.</p><p>I was floored to hear that the group also included fellow Harlemite Teyana Taylor (who ended up signing to Pharrell's now-defunct Star Trak imprint) and Lil Mama (who ended up signing to Jive).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nicolette herself ended up signing a deal under iconic MC LL Cool J. It came about randomly after her mother spotted him on the street, which led to the young spitter freestyling for the&amp;nbsp;legend — and later that same night hitting the studio with him.</p>

<p>She appeared on his <em>Exit 13</em> album, alongside Jiz, Lyrikal and Trick Diamondz on "Get Over Here." She also made a cameo in the video for the album's brightest star, "Baby," featuring The-Dream.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Still, signing to an established artist often leaves signees at the mercy of the artist's creative drive.</p><p>In this case, <em>Exit 13</em>'s handling by long-time label Def Jam was criticized heavily by LL — and ended up being his last for the imprint.</p><p>As well, he was knee-deep in <em>NCIS</em>, leaving his focus anywhere but on Nicolette.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They split on good terms, and Nicolette herself recounts her time with the legendary MC as incredibly reaffirming.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>What makes her story so compelling, for me, is her strength and determination.</p><p>The more you dig, the more you can see just how hard she's been working to get her music to pop — amid a lot of soul-crushing obstacles.&amp;nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2013, her sister Olivia was murdered; a subsequent lawsuit filed by Nicolette's mother against <a href="http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2015/sep/24/nycha-urged-take-responsibility-murder-olivia-brow/">New York City Housing Authority</a> was met with a shocking response:  should have been aware of the safety risk of living in NYCHA housing.</p><p>Even worse, the egregiously bad take was published on the front page of the New York Post.</p>

<p>Michele Graham, the 37-year-old woman who shot Olivia, was s<a href="https://patch.com/new-york/harlem/woman-sentenced-21-years-prison-2013-harlem-shooting">entenced to 21 years in prison</a> in 2016 after pleading guilty to first-degree manslaughter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More recently, Nicolette has had to deal with the loss of both her mother and another close friend Hooliganradguitar5 — which she's seemingly taking in stride, channeling it as added motivation to achieve what seems like an inevitable goal in their honor.&amp;nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is inevitable; you can feel the contagiously positive spirit in her voice as she speaks.</p><p>From her ongoing professional relationship with Dame Dash to her working relationship with Ron Browz (among many others), she is in the right circles, and thankfully — for many reasons — she has a great support system. <br></p>
