– Egypt Taylor</blockquote>
Philadelphia has a long and prestigious history in hip-hop.</p><p>One of our contributors <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/sounds-of-philadelphia/">once began to break it down</a>, but a timeline that starts with names like Schooly D and Fresh Prince, and leads to names like Beanie Siegel and Meek Mill, the city has long emblazoned its unique mark on hip-hop culture.</p><p>But it’s a new day, and new voices are emerging.</p><p>Once of these new voices is Egypt Taylor – a member of The <a href="http://www.foursevenmgmt.com/#music-section">Prodigies</a> collective.</p><p>Currently, on tour with the collective, Egypt has been busy prepping a new EP, but – alongside the release of Kanye’s <em>Waves</em> album – is dropping a new song titled <em>Champion</em>, produced by Kanye West himself.</p><p>Needless to say, having a song produced by Kanye West is a great look for such a new artist; actually, that's an understatement.</p><p>A Kanye West beat in 2016 is something most artists will <em>never</em> achieve!</p><p>We wanted to learn more about the song, so we linked up with Egypt for a quick Q&amp;A. Check that out below, and take an ear to <em>Champion</em>, produced by Kanye.



<hr />

<strong>How did you get into hip-hop?
</strong>
I got into hip-hop growing up around my cousin Kravitz, who was a producer at the time.</p><p>He would make beats on his AKAI pad, and I would try to make my poems flow over his beats.

<strong>Who are/were some of your influences?
</strong>
My main influences would have to be MF DOOM, Jay-Z, Kool &amp; The Gang, and, of course, Kanye.

<strong>Can you describe your sound?
</strong>
I don’t have a particular sound that I consistently aim for when writing a song.</p><p>The sound I hope to deliver varies from project to project and usually depends on how I'm feeling on that particular day.</p><p>But I usually get that I have an old-school hip-hop sound in a lot of my tracks.

<strong>Tell me about your new track champion?</p><p>How did the song come together?
</strong>
Champion is a crazy song.</p><p>It’s different from my other projects, mainly because of the production.</p><p>Kanye’s influence and work ethic makes the song stand out, which is great because it allowed me to write from a different creative perspective.

<strong>Have you been sitting on this track for a while?
</strong>
Yea, we were sitting on this track for a couple of months.</p><p>The sound didn't fit the tone of my upcoming EP or anything I had planned on releasing soon, so we decided it was best to release it as a single along with the upcoming release of “Waves.”

<strong>With the release of waves, this is pretty great timing on your part.</p><p>Besides Ye What other artists are you currently working with?
</strong>
Yea, the timing is bittersweet.</p><p>Kanye is a great producer and artist and has established himself as such.</p><p>Having the exposure from a music legend is helpful for an upcoming artist, but it can also overshadow your work as a relatively underground artist.</p><p>I am currently working on a track with Lil 100 from SODMG and a project with my collective member APEX Predator.

<strong>What should we be looking out for?</strong>

You should most certainly be bracing yourself for APEX Predator’s self-titled, debut EP dropping on Feb. 15.</p><p>As well as a few tracks featuring me and Kurt from Good Money Empire.

<strong>Do you have an LP on the horizon?</strong>

No.</p><p>There is a debut EP on the horizon though with some crazy features.</p><p>Look out for that around late spring/early summer.

<strong>What can you tell us about the prodigies?</strong>

The Prodigies is hip-hop collective and the title of the collective’s debut EP.</p><p>Collective members APEX Predator and Vaniah, are the main artists featured on the EP.</p><p>It was released to give listeners a glance at the different vibes and sounds the collective hopes to deliver on their individual projects.

<strong>How has the tour been thus far?</strong>

The tour has been amazing.</p><p>As an upcoming artist, it is always great to get that initial support from your fans and listeners.</p><p>Seeing people rock with you to your art at a live performance is motivating and encouraging.

<strong>What has been your favorite show thus far?</strong>

The Philadelphia hip-hop scene as a whole has been my personal favorite place to perform.</p><p>From the El to the venues, to Love Park, Philadelphians have always shown support, and that’s mad dope being a non-native to Philly.

<strong>Are you guys working on more projects like this?</strong>

Yea, we hope to release more projects like this from other members of the collective to bring together the various sounds of different members on one whole project.

<strong>What are your goals in the music industry?</strong>

My goals as an artist are to continue to inspire others to create long lasting, and call-to-action music.</p><p>Music is an excellent form of communication because it reaches the general public daily.</p><p>Aside from writing about wildlife experiences, I hope to create meaningful songs that inspire others to do good and bring unity to humanity.

<strong>What is one thing you'd like your listeners to know about you as an artist?</strong>

I want my listeners to know that I am human, and I have emotions.</p><p>They change daily and sometimes hourly.</p><p>Those emotions and feelings can be heard and felt in my projects and may seem to produce an inconsistency.</p><p>But I am always the same person despite the sound of my music.
