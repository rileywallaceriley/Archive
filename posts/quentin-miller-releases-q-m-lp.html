    <h1>Quentin Miller Releases “Q.M.” LP</h1>
    <div class="meta">2018-07-13 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>After wiping his Twitter earlier this month and teasing a new release, Quentin Miller returns with a brand new LP, titled Q.M. The official follow-up to last summer’s Falco (which featured a collaboration with Pusha T), the 11-song effort is light on features and heavy on bars.Described by Miller himself as his most time-consuming and expensive effort to date, the project features Pe$o, Soundz, Hit-Boy, and his WDNG Crshrs partner TheCoolisMac.Check out the stream below.https://open.spotify.com/album/0GlRWbwISGbBOWILAewU71?si=EMTSQ52ZQuuSxpdUFer_cQ[apple_news_ad type="any"]</p></div>
