This is <em>not</em> Donuts.</p><p>A posthumous release from the J.Dilla camp, Dillatronic is a 41 track sonic ride featuring all-new unreleased material from the undisputed messiah of underground hip-hop production.</p><p>So why did I start this review off with a statement like this ain’t Donuts?</p><p>Well, it isn’t.</p><p>Donuts was a cohesive project, which had Dilla’s stank all over it, beyond the beats themselves, and into the actual arrangement and ora of the seminal example of what a beat tape <em>should</em> be.</p><p>Dillatronic was produced by Dilla, there’s no argument there, but it lacks the same emotional punch that his earlier work had.</p><p>It’s better to approach this work for what it is, though – a beat tape.</p><p>Had you chosen to purchase one of these beats, Dilla would have refined it for you likely – or in the case of the 30 and 60 second loops, finished it.</p><p>Much like a notebook full of 2Pac’s scribbled lyrics and ideas, or old parchments that contain sketches by Leonardo DaVinci, Dillatronic is a collection of sonic sketches and ideas.</p><p>They likely evolved into some of his more memorable pieces, or died at the cutting table and remained nothing more than a lost loop on an MPC formatted floppy sitting in a storage facility.</p><p>It does have clearly brilliant stuff here!</p><p>As I’m writing, I’m listening to the heavy vibrating bass of Dillatronic 29.</p><p>Dillatronic 05, 12, 12, 17, 20-21, 32-33 and 41 are also must-listens.</p><p>This is a tape that any and all MC’s need to bump and write to – and Dilla-fanatics need to add to their collection.</p><p>Don’t pit this against Ruff Draft or Donuts – it’s not fair. this is an unearthed collection of Dilla beats that are perfect for a midnight ride through the city on a sticky summer evening.</p><p>RIP to the greatest.</p></div>
