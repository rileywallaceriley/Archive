  <h1>Killa Kyleon Releases New EP, Lorraine Motel, Honoring The Late Dr. Martin Luther King</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Killa Kyleon remains one of the South’s most talented, crafty, hard-working and diverse artists.</p><p>He's got ambitious plans for 2017, including a new album, <em>Texas Plates &amp; Candy Paint 3</em>, which will be released this spring and includes guest appearances from Bun B, Scarface, Devin The Dude, A$AP Rocky, A$AP Ferg, Willie D, &amp; Young Dolph among others.</p><p>Before his proper album arrives, Killa Kyleon has dopped his new EP, <em>Lorraine Motel</em>, a conceptual project that honors the legacy of historic black leaders and figures, chiefly, Dr.</p><p>Martin Luther King, who was assassinated on April 4th, 1968 at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, TN.

“The <em>Lorraine Motel</em> project is directed at what's going on in today's society within the black community as a whole” Killa Kyleon states. “It’s not a one-sided commentary; it deals with the treatment people of color have been receiving from law enforcement and how we are programmed and influenced by social media, television and the culture of Hip-Hop to treat each other as well.</p><p>As a race and culture, we need to stand together, but also take accountability for our actions.</p><p>I feel the black American dream and ideal died when MLK was murdered in Memphis (at the Lorraine Motel).</p><p>So I created this conceptual project as an analogy of today’s climate in America.</p><p>We all (African Americans) died that day at the Lorraine Motel.</p><p>Barack Obama is the last of one of our strongest black leaders to lead us as a race.</p><p>The <em>Lorraine Motel</em> project focuses on events (both past and current) that have taken place since that fatal day.”
