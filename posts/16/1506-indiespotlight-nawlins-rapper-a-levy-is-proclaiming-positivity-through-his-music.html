  <h1>#IndieSpotlight: N'awlins Rapper A. Levy Is Proclaiming Positivity Through His Music</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sat, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>New Orleans rapper A. Levy wears many hats: hip-hop artist, audio engineer, t-shirt brand owner, father, and husband.</p><p>His music is a mixture of lyrical storytelling, and golden era aesthetics, and contemporary production. "I'm influenced by a lot of things and try to touch on subjects I feel are neglected," he tells AAHH in an interview.</p><p>The celebrated emcee started off his career making parodies and remixes of radio songs. "I'm from New Orleans," he says, "so Mac, Fiend, Mystikal, No Limit and the Cash Money camp influenced me," he says, also naming Nas, Outkast, and Kendrick Lamar who give him inspiration from to pen songs.</p><p>His journey has been long, with many drops along the way. "To date, I've released too many projects to remember," he says with a laugh. "I started off under the name Young Duece.</p><p>After a conversation with a local radio personality, I changed it to the most natural thing I could think of ... my name." Some of his past projects include Commercial Break, Best You Never Heard Of, Crashed Harddrive, Super Ugly, Crescent City Classic, and a few others.


"Right now, I'm working on collecting original production with no samples," he reveals. "My heart tells me to do samples, but financially that's not the wisest move when it's time for radio, tv, movie and video game placements."

He's received a ton of recognition thus far. "The Source has covered me, XXL, 2DopeBoyz, BBC, performed in Thailand, London, Aruba and successfully did three national tours all in the last three years." That has all been independent, too. "I've  been nominated for and won a few NOLA music awards," he says proudly.

"I record mix and master my music," he adds. "I book my shows and do my PR, all while holding down a full-time job.</p><p>My studio -- The Hut Studios --has been a local staple for the last decade for some of the best indie artists in the area.</p><p>In addition to all that I also throw monthly showcases and festivals in the states."

He is quick to note his primary goal as amassing as much influence as possible. "I want to put my city in the best and most accurate light possible.</p><p>We're a city full of lyricists, pop artist, and street artist, but to date, only one part of our story has been told prominently.</p><p>I want to be a part of spreading positivity."

"I'm signed to myself.</p><p>I don't foresee myself signing any major label deals.</p><p>I've personally had horror stories and heard twice as many from my peers," he says.</p><p>Next up is more touring.</p><p>Bigger and better stages.</p><p>Festivals, TV, and radio are all in play right now."

"It's a great time...even better it's the best time of my career thus far."
