  <h1>Sain – They Don't Know Remix</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Master P  helped the southern hip-hop scene (specifically the NO) go mainstream, Mac Miller and Wiz Khalifa contributed to making Pittsburgh a viable name in the game, and Drake pretty much made "the 6" a thing -- literally.</p><p>We're kind of sure he coined the term.</p><p>Now, rapper Sain,  who was born in Miami, is hoping to do the same for Dubai, the man-made paradise in the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>With achievements that include nailing sponsorship deals with brands such as Casio’s G-Shock and Marc Ecko's once coveted clothing brand, and sharing the stage with Missy Elliot, Cee Lo Green, Akon, and many more, Sain (pronounced Sane) is on his way.</p><p>His latest release, the remix to his record "They Don't Know," is at one a comment on his endless grind, and a universal anthem for persevering.</p><p>A single from his upcoming LP <i>Chapters</i>, due out this season, the song (which features Eazi Money) could quickly become a summer banger.</p><p>Take an ear for yourself -- and if you're feeling it, add him up.
