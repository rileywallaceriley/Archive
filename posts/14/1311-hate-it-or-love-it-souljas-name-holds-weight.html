  <h1>Hate It Or Love It: Soulja's Name Holds Weight</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>It wouldn't be accurate to call Soulja unsuccessful by any means; in fact, his debut single went triple platinum.</p><p>Realistically, he's still eating off of that.</p><p>He has emerged as a smart businessman, though, spinning his single into a $23 million-plus empire that spans from endorsement deals, television--even a club--as well as his questionable music.</p><p>With a decade in the game, he's proved himself to be a trendsetter in every sense of the word.</p><p>Most recently, he's kept his name ringing with an almost calculated series of 'tough-guy-isms' that have inadvertently amused black twitter to no end—but, the joke is really on us.</p><p>Whether brandishing guns on the gram, beefing with Yachty over a girl, embellishing an attempted robbery story or—within the past 24 hours—throwing shots of Chris Brown  and (seemingly) being robbed while showing his hood-cred via Facebook live, he's managed to keep his name ringing, for better or for worse.</p><p>I almost liken it to Lil' B; those who like him love him.</p><p>There's no middle ground, ultimately.</p><p>His supporters were out in full force recently and ready to offer praise to young Soulja after he gave his fans a gift—free Bluetooth headphones.</p><p>Granted, there was a questionably high shipping rate attached to that, but still, he's doing his best to weigh the Good with the bad.</p><p>As well, last weekend's #souljaboychallenge made a potentially embarrassing situation a social media phenomenon.</p><p>This all adds fuel to the flame, and makes the probability of him snagging more lucrative endorsements that much more likely.</p><p>We he lacks in actual bars, he's seemingly making up for with racks and success.</p><p>I ain't even mad—get yours, kid!</p></div>
