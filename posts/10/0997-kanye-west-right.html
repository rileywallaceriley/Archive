Beck beat Beyoncé – and it seemed as though Kanye was going to storm the stage à la Taylor Swift.</p><p>Instead, he spun it into one of the best memes of the year (thus far).</p><p>It was later though, while he was taking to E! that he <a href="http://youtu.be/E95bOqOIkjM">dropped a great nugget</a>.</p><p>Sure, crazy old Kanye was ranting again, but look past that.</p><p>Kanye is right, we have to fight for art and creativity.</p><p>The issue that the average (media) consumer may have is that comparing Beyoncé and Beck is difficult, as they're different genres, demographic (and so on).</p><p>But face it, award shows do have a tendency to shit on creativity and award (often) mediocracy; however, I'm not saying Beck was mediocre <em>at all.</em> The choice of winner has often proven to not be based on album sales alone, which leaves the final decisions in the hands of a shadowy jury who choose songs based on, well... .</p><p>Kanye's rant during the Taylor Swift award was shaky – <em>Single Ladies</em> was cool, but greatest of all-time?</p><p>Let's just say that was the Hennessy talking.</p><p>But this time around his rant checks out.</p><p>Beyoncé's was so incredibly ambitious, large in scale and visually/creatively amazing.</p><p>It was the fastest selling album in I-Tunes history, and has sold well over 5 million copies.</p><p>How did it not win?</p><p>At some point award shows and awarding bodies need to stop making choices motivated by, well, I'm not exactly sure.</p><p>Money?</p><p>I mean even Eminem (no disrespect) probably didn't deserve to win an award with that lifeless reboot of <em>The Marshall Mathers LP</em>.</p><p>To play devil's advocate, creativity can be subjective – but it's hard to ignore that creativity is rarely awarded.</p><p>At some point real artists will stop caring.</p><p>When the biggest platforms, which arguably influence sales and trends, stop giving a shit, how long before artists start to do the same?</p><p>As Kanye stated, "If the Grammys want real artists to keep coming back, they need to stop playing with us...”
