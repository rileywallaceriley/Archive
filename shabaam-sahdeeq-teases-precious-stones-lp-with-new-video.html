    <h1>Shabaam Sahdeeq Teases "Precious Stones" LP With New Video</h1>
    <div class="meta">2019-10-23 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>With his upcoming LP Precious Stones (produced entirely by J57) about to drop before the end of 2019, one-time Rawkus roster member Shabaam Sahdeeq drops a new visual for the bubbling second single, "Steady Pace." Featuring cuts from German turntablist Chinch 33, the single has been getting a consistent burn from the incomparable DJ Premier via his weekly Live from HeadQCourterz show on Shade45. "Steady Pace" is the follow-up to August's "Razor Sharp Vernacular" single featuring Born Unique and Tri state. In an interview with HipHopDX, Shabaam said his collaborative project with J57 had been years in the making. "Me and J57 met at the Fat Beats flagship store In NY years ago, and we always stayed cool," he says. "I went to events their frequently and did business with Fat Beats on some independent records that I put out over the years.</p>
<p>We finally got to work together on a song called 'GMR,' which I put out as a one-off single … it did very well." The third single from the LP "Man Down," which features former D-Block rhymer J-Hood and DV Alias Khryst, is set to drop next week. Stream Shabaam Sahdeeq and J57's "Steady Pace" above.</p></div>
