Marq Beyond of Rosewood 2055</blockquote>
Don’t sleep on the opening act!</p><p>Admittedly, the first time I came upon Rosewood 2055, formally The Action Figures, was this past weekend when I stumble upon the latest joint by Slum Village,<a href=" E(I)GO</em></a>.</p><p>After a little research, I discovered that the duo have been touring the world with the Detroit-bred institution (that originally counted <a title="Happy Dilla Day" href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/happy-dilla-day/">Dilla</a> as part of their roster) and have worked with the likes of <a href=" Simpson</a> and Statik Selecktah (amongst others).</p><p>What was even more surprising, was that their upcoming <em>Top Ramen</em> is their debut mix-tape (sans some singles).</p><p>They have a journey ahead of them, but their current team and show dates have them primed to make some serious noise this year.</p><p>I reached out to Marq Beyond, on half of Rosewood, to learn a little more about the duo.

<hr>

<strong>Who are Rosewood 2055?</strong>

Kysean and Marq Beyond.</p><p>Two kids from Grand Rapids, MI.

<strong>How did you come together – and what prompted your name change?</strong>

We met in High School, I had a crew I ran with and was known for being the rapper.</p><p>Ky and I were cool, but I didnt get to know him til later and I was blown away by how passionate and knowledgeable he was on Hip Hop and the culture.</p><p>We just clicked.</p><p>The Action Figures grew to be bigger than both of us and it's more of an ideal and way of life.</p><p>So TAF is Wu Tang and Rosewood 2055 is Rae and Ghost. 2055 Rosewood Ave is the address of the High School we went to.

<strong>Who were/are some of your influences?</strong>

The culture in general is what influences us most.</p><p>What it means and stands for.</p><p>Everyone who's contributed to the culture included.

<strong>How do you define your sound?</strong>

I wouldn't say there's any definitive sound.</p><p>We both have our own ideas for songs and music and we bring the best of what we have and meet in the middle.</p><p>The only thing we never, ever compromise is lyricism.</p><p>So as long as we're free to say what we like, how we like, its a 20's record.

<strong>Who are some of the artists you've worked with?</strong>

We've worked with Lee Bannon, Chuck Strangers, Rapper Big Pooh, Guilty Simpson, Statik Selektah, Illmind, Earlly Mac etc.</p><p>We like to work with a variety of different artists, to pull from different avenues of inspiration and creativity.</p><p>We got a few surprises coming soon as well.

<strong>How did you connect with Slum Village?</strong>

Our management has had a close relationship with them for awhile.</p><p>We sent them some music and they asked us to come out.</p><p>We all ended up clicking, and they're like our big brothers now.

<strong>How has working with them helped to shape you as artists?</strong>

<strong>
</strong>

It definitely changed the way we work.</p><p>They work so fast and move even faster, so it was either keep up or get left behind.</p><p>They made us rededicate ourselves to the craft too!</p><p>We've spent days at a time locked in the studio.</p><p>The shortest session was probably 10 hours.</p><p>We know now, that its work and you get back what you put in.

<strong>How's the tour life?</strong>

Touring is dope as hell man.</p><p>Thats the part we've always wanted most.</p><p>Being in a new city, connecting.</p><p>Its can be hectic, with schedules to keep but its worth the early hours.</p><p>For sure.

<strong>What was your fave show so far?</strong>

New York cause it was the very first night, or Milan, Italy.

<strong>It's astounding that you haven't even released your debut yet!</p><p>What can we expect from <em>Top Ramen</em>?</strong>

Just expect good Hip Hop lol.</p><p>We want everybody to be excited about getting some good Hip Hop first and foremost.

<strong>What are your goals?</strong>

The goal is to keep growing, and keep moving as a unit.</p><p>With that in mind, we hope to get to a Slum Status one day.

<strong>Think quick: top 3 albums – go!</strong>

<em>Thriller</em>
<em> Reasonable Doubt</em>
<em> Late Registration</em>

<strong>Any last words for our readers?</strong>
