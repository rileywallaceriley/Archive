  <h1>Logic's "Everybody" Album Predicted To Top Billboard 200 Over Kendrick Lamar's "DAMN."</h1>
  <div class="meta">2017-05-09 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Even if the hosts of Everyday Struggle — Akademiks and Joe Budden — aren't full onboard the Logic train, as evidenced by today's episode, the quiet behemoth has a fan base propelling his latest album, Everybody, to the top.</p><p>After a week that's included landing in the cover of Complex with Neil Degrasse Tyson — who appears on the album — it seems Logic's album is about to come in at #1 on the Billboard 200, according to the publication.This would knock Kendrick Lamar's DAMN. off the throne.</p><p>Kung Fu Kenny has held the top spot on the Billboard 200 for three weeks straight, but is expected to slide down to #3 with Logic's debut and the release of Chris Stapleton’s From a Room: Volume 1.Logic's followers, many of whom tweeted images of themselves purchasing as many copies as they could from local retailers, have pushed the album to upwards of 210,000 units sold in its first week.</p><p>This will be the biggest debut of his career.His studio debut, 2014's Under Pressure, landed at #2 on the Top Hip Hop/R&B Chart its first week with 70,000 units.</p><p>However, it didn't fare as well in the Billboard 200.</p><p>That all changed with 2015's The Incredible True Story debuting at #3 on the Billboard 200 and topping the Top Hip Hop/R&B chart with 135,000 in its first week.</p><p>Both albums have since been certified gold by the RIAA.Another tremendous achievement is that as of this past January, Logic's music was streamed over 1.1 billion times on Spotify.</p><p>That doesn't include YouTube, SoundCloud, Google Play, Apple Music, or TIDAL (if that's your thing).</p><p>So the answer to the smart aleck question of who listens to Logic is a lot of people.His newest collection of music has inadvertently made him one of the most outspoken rappers in Hip Hop, which isn't sitting well with everyone.</p><p>Some have criticized his focus on his biracial ethnicity as slightly overbearing.But, love or hate Logic, he's doing crazy numbers.He recently announced that his next album would be his last.</p><p>You can read all about that here.</p></div>
