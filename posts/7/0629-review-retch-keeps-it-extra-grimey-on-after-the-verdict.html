  <h1>Review: ReTcH Keeps It Extra Grimey On “After The Verdict”</h1>
  <div class="meta">2018-07-12 — reviews</div>
  <div class="content"><p>New Jersey's ReTcH is one of those rappers who — like many before him — walks a lot of the talk he cements on wax.</p><p>Unfortunately for him, it’s resulted in multiple jail stints.</p><p>Last year probation violation had him locked down for eight months, finally hitting the streets as a free man last October.That wasn’t the most severe situation, though.</p><p>He was facing minimum 20-years for an alleged armed robbery.</p><p>It’s a case he officially beat this past March, hence the title of his latest release, the 10-song grime fest After The Verdict.https://youtu.be/bjCiBtZ30ywIn many ways, the project is a return to his roots.</p><p>The gritty vibes the Hz crew member brought to his debut Polo Sporting Goods and sophomore Finesse The World was slowly replaced by a trap vibe.</p><p>It was subtle on Lean & Neck and not so much on his post-jail EP Still Up.</p><p>Not that his brand of trap is inauthentic in any way; the opposite applies actually.</p><p>After The Verdict, though, is a ReTcH at his best: aggressive, raspy bars, few choruses, and no gimmicks.Crafted entirely by producer Grimm Doza, the LP’s aura is dark; think — blindfolded in moonlit woods without a flashlight — dark. “Dubs & Losses” which features Roc Marciano, is the brightest tune on the tape, and even its haunting organs requires a screwface and tilted nod to listen.</p><p>Other standout cameos include Tsu Surf on “Made It Out,” and Dave East on “Paranoia” — two must-have for hardcore enthusiasts.Oddly, in accordance with the album's title, there isn’t much direct response to his trial (save for “Dubs & Losses” where he respectably notes, “I did some shit could get me sent that I can't speak about”) but there are hints of retrospection to be found. “Late Night” holds claim to the boom-bap sound as he spits “Late night on the freeway, riding by my solo, cut the trap music, throw on something made for grown folk ...</p><p>Dru Hill knocking, feel the beauty in the south too, forever prevailing over obstacles.” And without getting too deep, he does spit, “going to trial, that's the toughest shit I ever did, nigga pointing from the stand right in front my kid ... same nigga that I used to call my fucking brother.” This is perhaps a nod to his fallout with one-time partner, Da$h.https://youtu.be/_1xkPLy4m68Overall, the project is cohesive, atmospheric, and ideal length — but with the lingering taste of overcoming a potentially life-changing obstacle — a maximum 65 years under the jail, it isn’t really a fun listen.</p><p>And understandably could be labeled as a bit repetitive.</p><p>Yet for longtime supporters and followers of this lean-sipping rebel, they'll be happy he's back in the mix.</p></div>
