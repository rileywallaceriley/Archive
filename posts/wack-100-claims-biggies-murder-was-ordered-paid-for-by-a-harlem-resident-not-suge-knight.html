    <h1>Wack 100 Claims Biggie's Murder Was Ordered & Paid For By A Harlem Resident Not Suge Knight</h1>
    <div class="meta">2017-05-05 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>The Game's manager and notorious drama-setter Wack 100 is back today with another "revelation" about one Hip Hop icon — just days after Funkmaster Flex went on the record claiming Tupac shot himself in the leg during the robbery in Quad Studios in New York City.While most of the recent focus has been on 'Pac, and what really happened the night he was fatally shot in Las Vegas, Wack took to Instagram live to discuss the murder of Biggie Smalls, who he claims wasn't murdered as a result of the widely held belief that 'Pac — who Flex claims knew the identity of his actual shooter — blamed Biggie for the Quad Studios shooting, which led to the eventual assassination in 1997. "Flex, that ain't what happened, you know it — Puff knows it.""Big wasn't murdered behind what happened in Vegas," Wack states, "he was murdered behind the politics and orders of a Harlem nigga, and the trigger-finger of a West Coast nigga." For his part, Wack makes a compelling (though unoriginal) argument: Death Row Records and Bad Boy Entertainment had a volatile, yet dependent relationship. As we've come to accept as a norm in later years, beef sells records.</p>
<p>According to Wack, Suge killing Biggie would've been bad business. "Suge Knight would never have been that stupid."Wack also prompted viewers to research Tha Realest, who was signed to Death Row in 1996 as an artist who Suge was allegedly priming to go at Biggie in an effort to reignite the beef and cash in. Tha Realest, who appeared on a handful of records before leaving the label in 2001, did have a cadence that was eerily similar to 2Pac, especially with his early releases under the label.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JSaoptVreIWhen prompted about 'Pac, Wack was quick to say "We're not talking about who killed 'Pac...It was what it was." He also added that many in the know — including individuals in New York (Flex) — are well aware of how Biggie was killed, and the identity of 'Pac's shooter.</p>
<p>Wack added, "someone close to him made him a sacrificial lamb." It doesn't get more cryptic than that.While we're not likely to every learn the truth about what happened to two of rap's most beloved golden era icons, we can be sure that major characters in the know like Wack, Flex — and Suge's associates — will keep dropping varying degrees of truth for heads to debate endlessly.</p></div>
