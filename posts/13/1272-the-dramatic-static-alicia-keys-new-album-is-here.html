  <h1>The Dramatic Static: The New Alicia Keys Album Is Here</h1>

  <div class="content"><p>First off, excuse the unintentional pun in the title.</p><p>Now, there's always been this hip-hop edge to Alicia Keys that I've loved; she has this beauty and grace about her, but her gorgeous vocals have a certain soulfulness to it that's hard to fake.</p><p>Since she dropped "<a href=" with a visual that followed the corn-rowed singer visiting her boyfriend in jail, the NYC songstress has been making an exuberant blend of both motivational and love songs from the perspective of the underdog -- that so happens also to appeal to the struggling dreamer in all of us.</p><p>For day one fans, she's grown up -- but so have we; I remember bumping her debut album in my Discman while wearing a Durag and oversized throwback jersey.</p><p>She's now a mother, wife, and actress, amongst other things.</p><p>But no matter how much things change, she never seems to forget where she came from or lose the fundamental elements that birthed her musical nucleus in the first place.</p><p>That could've been exemplified any better on <em>Here</em>, her highly anticipated new record that hit Apple Music this morning.</p><p>The album begins with a spoken-word piece, followed by "The Gospel," an energetic piano driven record that stems from her upbringing Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan; "...in my tenement, listening to the hook -- 'Change gon come,' spirit of Sam Cook." From here, without wavering too far from the aura of openness she creates, she explores a multitude of themes.</p><p>They range from addiction ("Illusion of Bliss"), women's rights ("Girl Can't Be Herself"), to being a step parent on the A$AP Rocky-assisted "Blended Family," which we saw a few weeks ago.</p><p>Two standout records -- for me -- were "Pawn It All," which floats themes of giving it all up and starting anew, and the über jazzy hip-hop infused "She Don't Really Care." The latter's use of not only the classic "<a href=" Applubum</a>" break, and Nas's iconic Q-Tip produced "<a href=" Love</a>," but a subtle nod to UTFO's "Roxanne Roxanne" with her intro chant of "oh yeah, oh yeah."

Alicia Keys made headlines over the past months for not wearing makeup, which is bananas.</p><p>She's a beautiful girl -- with or without it.</p><p>This sentiment, which is a not so subtle commentary on the constraints the media and society place on women. "Girl Can't Be Herself" discusses how her heart breaks seeing girls who can't truly be themselves; "Who says I should conceal what I'm made of -- maybe all this Maybelline is covering my self-esteem."

The album ends with "Holy War," a heartfelt call to "love somebody instead of polishing the bombs of holy war." The euphemism is used to describe the  segregation we as people have ultimately constructed.</p><p>She questions near the song's end, "what if love was holy, and war was obscene."

This record is an important one, and I honestly see it as Alicia Keys emitting a brand of truth, emotion, and power that is reminiscent of artists like Nina Simone. <em>Here </em>is a beautiful album, and a breath of fresh air.</p><p>Thank you, Alicia.</p></div>
