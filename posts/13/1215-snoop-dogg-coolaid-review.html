  <h1>Snoop Dogg – Coolaid (Review)</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>"First N--ga taught that crippin' to your kids, huh," proclaims Snoop Dogg -- and rightfully so.</p><p>Unless the average middle class American  kid was jamming to groups to Compton's Most Wanted, which wasn't a sure bet in pre-Internet hip-hop, Snoop's brand of 'Gangsta Rap' on the much-lauded Doggystyle was an eye opening experience.</p><p>So much so that they tried to shut the genre down, ironically giving it more allure (like telling kids to stop smoking).</p><p>Since then  Snoop has soared to unbelievable heights; from making too many classics to list here, to television appearances and cult status.</p><p>He's the most recognizable face in hip-hop history, his latest album, Coolaid, seems like a victory lap.</p><p>Last week Snoopy unleashed the project's lead single, "Super Crip," produced by heavyweight Just Blaze.</p><p>The track was an exciting reworking of the iconic west coast funk of yesterday, with an undeniably current feel.</p><p>Over the electric soundbed, Snoop sounded reinvigorated, and fresh.</p><p>Coolaid, as a complete package, is much the same.</p><p>Snoop is a legend, and he knows it -- he spends a good portion of the project's 20 tracks exploring his status, reminding everyone that he's the nucleus of west coast hip-hop, and giving long-time fans the refreshed, focused Snoop Dogg they deserve.</p><p>The album seems to have three very distinct lanes, thick, syrupy, west coast funk, music to crip to, and filler.</p><p>The latter includes songs like the "My Carz," and the album's intro, "Legend," with an awkward slow-flow on a one-off trap beat that seems out of place.</p><p>Snoop hits his stride, though, as soon as the second joint, "Ten Toes Down," drops.</p><p>From the Paid In Full excerpt, we can begin to understand that Snoop wants listeners to know that he (just) can't leave the game alone.</p><p>Perhaps, he wonders if completely abandoning his core audience would render him forgotten, much like Mitch contemplated in the emotionally charged scene .</p><p>On the song "Coolaid Man," Snoop subtly let's other artists know that not only does he not sound like anyone else out -- but that he's aware of who's been borrowing his style.</p><p>With multiple collaborations with Alicia Keys' beau Swizz Beats and Just Blaze, and guests verses from the likes of his smoking buddy (and Mac &amp; Dre co-star) Wiz Khalifa, Detroit Capo Trick Trick, and west coast legend in his own right, Suga Free (amongst a host of other), Snoop delivers a solid track list.</p><p>If the west side street-hop doesn't hit you, the radio-ready vibe of "Point Seen Money," featuring Jeremih, the funky "Feel About Snoop," or the club-ready "Double Tap," featuring E-40 and Jazzy Pha, will.</p><p>There's something for everyone, no matter which era/iteration of Snoop you've come to most closely identify with.</p><p>From the super dope artwork to the overall vibe, the project is worth a spot on your summer playlist.</p><p>Roll a fatty, turn up, and beat the summer heat with tall glass of Cool Aid.</p></div>
