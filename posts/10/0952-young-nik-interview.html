<strong>What's good?</p><p>Tell everyone who you are and where you’re from?</strong>
 
Whats Upppp it’s your girl Saki Bomb bka Young Nik!</p><p>Im from Fort Greene, Brooklyn, by way of Japan...I'll explain that later.  
 
<strong>How long have you been in this Hip-Hop game?
 </strong>
Since 2008 when I dropped my video for "<em>Bouncers</em>".
 
<strong>What was your first exposure to Hip-Hop?</strong>
 
I would say the Lil Kim/Foxy Brown era hit me the hardest.</p><p>Biggie, Jay-Z...I'm from Brooklyn so you already know.
 
<strong>Who has influenced you? </strong>
 
James Brown, Lauren Hill, Lil Kim , Foxxy Brown, Queen Latifah, Biggie, Jay-Z, Limp Bizkit, Linkin' Park and my family, because my cousin wrote my first rap.</p><p>We would have the karaoke machine going and dubbing tapes.</p><p>Damn!</p><p>Fun times!
 
<strong>Define your style?</strong>
 
I call it “Hipclectic” because I sound like everything in one; Hip-Hop, R&amp;B and Pop.</p><p>It can be so diverse.</p><p>I had to make up a new genre.
 
<strong>What challenges do you face being a female MC?  </strong>
 
I would say breaking away from stereotypes that plague female Hip-Hop artists.</p><p>For example, females that slept their way to the top versus females with actual talent, grinding for their own respect for their craft.</p><p>Also companies thinking females are too emotional.</p><p>I mean, I am emotional, but I put it in my music not my business.</p><p>I’m worth the risk! 
 
<strong>Being from NYC, do you feel the road is even more difficult as opposed to other Femcees from other regions?  </strong>
 
Of course, Hip-Hop originated from NYC so they set higher standards in this part of town.</p><p>Not that I can't reach, but it’s easier for people from other places to be easily accepted, just by saying they're different (without necessarily being good).</p><p>I like competition though.</p><p>I usually feel I have none because I do me.</p><p>I don't follow others.</p><p>I create trends, I don't follow them. 
 
<strong>Where are some places you've performed at?</strong> 
 
Aramachi Lounge, SOB's, Times Square (100,000 people outside), Speed, 5Spot, Boston Concert Venue, Philly, Rose Castle…so many places. 
 
<strong>What are your Top 3 Hip-Hop albums of all time?</strong>
 
<em>Reasonable Doubt</em>, <em>Miseducation of Lauren Hill</em> and (Lil' Kim's) <em>Hardcore</em>.</p><p>Oh and Foxy Brown's <em>Broken Silence</em>...</p><p>I couldn't pIck just 3! 
 
<strong>What are your most memorable accomplishments to date? </strong>
 
Unsigned Hype in Source Magazine, Independent Artist in Source Magazine, Future Female in Straight Stuntin' Magazine, my jingle playing on Ms.</p><p>Jones morning show on Hot 97 for a year straight and winning the ILLMIND rhyme challenge in Brooklyn (Trophy). 
 
<strong>What advice would you give to young Femcees? </strong>
 
Stay true to yourself and do music that makes you feel good.</p><p>This game isn't for the faint of heart.</p><p>You have to be strong and always continue leaning.</p><p>You have to be able to handle people's opinions.</p><p>But, always stay open minded.   
 
<strong>What can we be expect from Young Nik going into 2015? </strong>
 
You can expect Young Nik to be Saki Bomb!
