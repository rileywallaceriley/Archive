  <h1>Aaron Cohen Wraps A Fruitful 2017 With A Trippy New Video</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Every single year I make a heap of predictions about all the artists I’ve dedicated my pen game to—and I’m often off the mark.</p><p>While I’m perhaps a little too optimistic about the music that moves me, sometimes I do get it right.</p><p>Seattle’s own <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/aaron-cohen-shows-love-to-50-cent-on-queen/">Aaron Cohen</a> is one of those artists.</p><p>I’ve helped premiere a few of his gems via XXL in the past and <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/aaron-cohen-off-the-ground/">written about him here</a>.</p><p>It’s been cool to see how far he’s come in the last 365 days.</p><p>Aside from a handful of bumping singles, Aaron spent a great deal of time overseas making moves and murking shows—even headlining a show in Paris—before returning stateside to rock out across the nation.</p><p>He’s been putting in some significant grind time, and it’s paying.</p><p>Capping off a year that included a hell of a lot of stage time and even a magazine cover in Paris, he recently dropped his latest visual “See Red,” a trippy treatment that sees Aaron essentially murdering himself—multiple times.</p><p>Check it out, below, and if you’ve been missing on Aaron this far, wake the f—k up and smell the Folgers, son.
