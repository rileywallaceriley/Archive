    <div class="content"><p>The entire Ruff Ryders family are currently mourning the death of Jay "Icepick" Jackson, a producer and A&R -- and most importantly close friend -- who passed way after a courageous battle with cancer. "He was also a BIG part of the Ruff Ryders movement," shared super-producer Swizz Beatz in a heartfelt Instagram post.Throughout the timeline of his career, he was hands on in various roles across the spectrum of the legendary collective's discography. He was credited as the executive producer on projects such as Eve's Scorpion and Eve-Olution albums, DMX's Grand Champ and Year of the Dog...Again, all of Jadakiss' solo releases.</p>
<p>That's just the tip of the iceberg.Described by many as a genuine, warm person, his death has affected many in the industry.Swizz Beatz, who is the godfather of Jay's son, noted on Instagram that he "wanted to spread how important it is as men to go see the doctor and check up on our health! That was his last request." Irv Gotti added in his Instagram post, "FUCK CANCER ... How is there not a cure in 2017 is beyond me."His final request is actually a very important message that should be kept in mind, especially as Hip Hop is getting older.</p>
<p>According to the American Cancer Society, about 1 man in 39 will die of prostate cancer -- and that's just one form of the deadly disease.Prays go out to his Jay's family -- and team!</p></div>
