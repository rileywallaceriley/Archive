  <h1>Rock Brings Wu-Tang & Boot Camp Together For New Single</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>A little over two years ago the Hip Hop world was rocked by the tragic and sudden loss of Rapper Sean Price, a member of the Boot Camp Clik, and one-half of the legendary duo Heltah Skeltah — alongside Jahmal Bush, better known as Rock.</p><p>Finally moving forward (professionally), Rock is making is first post-P foray, <em>Rockness A.P.</em> (After Price), which is--in essence--his first solo-project.

<a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/a-conversation-with-rock-of-heltah-skeltah/">In conversation with AAHH back in 2015</a>, Rock noted that he'd been working on his solo for a while. "Situations change, the sounds change, my ears change, and the message I may be trying to give the people may change," he said.

"The album is in the process.</p><p>Life happens though, and right now.</p><p>I just lost the Yin to my Yang … My brother just died.</p><p>So, there are changes that need to happen on my album now," he added.</p><p>He also shared some kind words and memories about his one-time partner in rhyme. "As unique as we all are as human beings, I mean, you may find somebody else at some point that reminds you of me, but you won’t find anyone that reminds you of him," he said. "He was one of one – and he chose me ."

Now, two years following that conversation, we're getting a first taste of what the project has to offer, "Camp-Wu." As the name suggests, it's a collaborative track with members of both Wu-Tang Clan (Inspectah Deck and Method Man) and Boot Camp (Tek and Steele).</p><p>The project itself drops on the 22nd and is available through <a href="https://www.facebook.com/digitaldejavurecords/">Digital Deja Vu Records</a>.</p><p>Check out the new single, below.
