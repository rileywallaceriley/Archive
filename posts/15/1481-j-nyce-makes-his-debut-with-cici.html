  <h1>J Nyce Makes His Debut With "CICI"</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Carolina-born and Atlanta-finessed J Nyce, known to his closest friends and family as Jake is quick to denote that he isn’t just another rapper. “I'm anything my artistic ability allows for me to be,”
He clarified to AAHH. “I do love to sing more than rap I think.”

A newcomer (seriously—his debut was last week), his music comes from his life experiences. “Pain, happiness, anger, shame, love, and hate are all emotions that I harness and let flow through my pen,” he says. “I write my music for a reason ... with a direction in mind.”

"I want you to feel something,” he continues. “I know that if I shed tears writing my new single, 'CICI' others would feel that same love.</p><p>So I'm a true artist.</p><p>I'm a real artist.</p><p>And I'm changing the world.”

Though this is his debut, he’s been making music for years. “I started rapping when Nas came out with "Ether,” he says.</p><p>He got his chops in high school cyphers battling for respect. “I guess that's why I'm so big on lyrical content and being able to perform,” he notes.

“My Mom and Dad used to always sing,” he says discussing his earlier influences. “I remember times of seeing my Mom sing at wedding receptions and different gatherings, not knowing that those were occasions that subconsciously affected my drive to want to be on the mic and in front of a crowd till now.“

<blockquote>“I came here for a reason.</p><p>I've always had dreams of being an awesome entertainer.</p><p>So here I am.”</blockquote>

“I'm currently working on my debut EP,”
He says proudly. “I'm working on becoming a household name like all of the greats.</p><p>And I'm well on my way!”

To date, he’s opened shows for the likes of Project Pat. “I've been all over the country touring, destroying mics, and making lifelong friends and fans,” he says. “Recently partnering up with one of the greatest engineers I've ever had the pleasure of working with, Andre Moss(Up Some More Studios), I was able to produce one of the best songs I've ever heard, “CiCi.”

His goals in the game? “Mainstream.</p><p>Mainstream.</p><p>Mainstream.”

“More tours, full radio rotation, a collab with Lil Wayne, and alot of business building,” he says.</p><p>Stay tuned.</p></div>
