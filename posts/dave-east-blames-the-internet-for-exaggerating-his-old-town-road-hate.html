But he did blame the internet for blowing it out of proportion.“Internet tried to twist the whole shit,” he says.East took to Instagram last week letting fans know his thoughts on the Billboard smash, stating: “I don’t know what the fuck is going on with Hip Hop; with rap [and] I ain’t no hater but that shit is wack.</p>
