  <h1>Sadistik Reveals Incredibly Dope Easter Egg He Left Fans & Breaks Down New LP 'Elysium'</h1>

<p>As I've been researching the book I'm writing about independent creatives, one figure I keep finding myself drawn to is Seattle alt-Hip Hop artist Sadistik.</p><p>He's a curious case study in audience creation; independently, he's landed high-profile press, crushed iTunes Charts, toured and even landed on <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/sadistik">Billboard</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He's someone I'd meant to tap for a while; however, a recent post by the Sadistik to his fans blew my mind, and I had to reach out.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His Patreon has roughly 150-200 higher tier members who receive exclusive merchandise drops every other month.</p><p>Approximately a year ago, he sent out some gear and a poster.</p><p>Unbeknownst to the recipients, that poster contained an Easter egg in plain sight — one that he is now revealing as part of the roll-out for his upcoming album, <em>Elysium</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"A big theme in my writing is hidden/double meanings, so I had the idea to hide a URL in the code on the back of all the photos," he explains.</p><p>The URL leads to an OG version of a verse — which has ultimately become his single "<a href="https://twitter.com/therealsadistik/status/1292179429641265153?s=21">Zodiac</a>," featuring Mick Jenkins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's a mind-bending level of engagement and foresight, something he says his fans have come to expect from him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I think attention to detail gets reciprocated with them," he tells me of his core fanbase. "They seem to enjoy finding the meanings as much as I do hiding them, so the idea sprung from that."</p>

<p>An example he shares is a line on his last LP <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4fUCyiqfFIeUUoqu9SRLpD?si=48Dh66gWTh-vVkhMO-MpAg">Haunted Gardens</a></em>, which subtly revealed the name of his next project.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The last line on the LP is, 'I dream I'm in Elysium but wake up to the same.' Now, a year later, <em>Elysium</em> will drop as the counterpart to <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0GXKK7b90gLJhhUsYrEL9I?si=gcNfZ6_FTa6fB3s2b0sQ4g">Delirium</a></em> (an EP released after <em>Haunted Gardens,</em>" he says.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Bread crumbs, I guess."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sadistik continues, breaking down the vision behind <em>Elysium</em>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Conceptually, <em>Delirium</em> is the abyss, it's the descent into Hell, whereas <em>Elysium</em> is about the ascent to heaven (or the Elysian Fields)," he explains. "In <em>Dante's Inferno</em>, the only way out of Hell is to travel through it; I tried to capture that through my lens.</p><p>With Elysium, the aim is to be a source of healing/introspect for people.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The last song on <em>Delirium</em> is called 'Aileen Wuornos' ... it's a soft song about a brutal subject of a serial killer, and it ends with her execution being compared to Christ," he says. " is meant to fade into 'Canary In A Mine' on <em>Elysium</em>, which signifies the ascent into Elysium or Heaven (or whatever you want to call it).</p>

<p>"Which is why the artwork/promo is black and white, they're supposed to be in stark contrast."</p>
