    <div class="content"><p>Waka Flocka has given fans a new timeframe for his long-awaited Flockaveli II, which was originally announced in 2013.This past summer, Waka took to Snapchat to tease a October 5 release date -- which has come and gone without a trace of the LP. Now, via an official statement from his camp, he's announced the project is set to drop early next year and hinted at data loss being the actual culprit behind the delay.“This is the fourth time I’ve made Flockaveli II,” Waka notes in the official press release. “I lost the original version when I lost my hard drives ... then I lost two more after that."Earlier this month, Waka gave a taste of what F2 had to offer with "“Trap My Ass Off” and "Circles" -- the latter being the only song that has carried over from the original iteration of Flockaveli II.“It’s the only record I have ever made that I had tears in my eyes,” Waka said of the autobiographical track. “It reminds me of all the pain I overcame.”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=douHpsXXk0UWaka originally blamed Atlantic Records for Flockavelli II's delay back in late 2015.</p>
<p>His departure from the label had fans hyped for its release, but the LP has remained in limbo.It's been a long wait but Waka is raising hopes for the LP, which still doesn't have an exact release date slated."Better delivery, better flow,” he promises. Waka insists that this album is his most personal and is meant for those who have been rocking with him through all the drama. “An album is supposed to be personal.</p>
<p>People want to hear me,” he says.In other Waka news, the rapper turned some heads with a controversial claim that he's not black during an interview with Sway Calloway. Read about it here.</p></div>
