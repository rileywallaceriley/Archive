  <h1>Fondle 'Em: A Legacy Of Dopeness</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>On Halloween-eve 2001, <a href="https://youtu.be/A17H7TWgaBs">Farewell Fondle 'Em</a> dropped and signalled the end of an era.</p><p>Fondle 'Em, owned and operated by Bobbito Garcia (of Stretch Armstrong Show fame), dropped a series of vinyl-only gems between 1995 and 2001.</p><p>A lot of artists and labels claim to be underground hip-hop , but this was the real deal.</p><p>Some of the rawest hip-hop ever pressed.</p><p>Alongside a few other labels, like Rawkus, it helped to sketch out the blueprint of how the sub-genre should look and sound.

<a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_5490.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium" title="" src="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_5490.jpg" alt="" width="109" height="170" /></a> Stretch and Bobbito fans will understand the organic nature of the labels origins.</p><p>The show – noted for breaking many legendary acts – was receiving demos from everyone and their mother.</p><p>Whether or not they considered themselves as such at the time, they were curators who helped shape the golden era New York scene.</p><p>A large portion of the dopeness they got their hands on came from unsigned acts.</p><p>Bobbito saw the opportunity to provide an outlet and the rest was history.</p><p>What started as kind of a joke, ended up a vastly curated catalogue of rare, and highly collectable, hip-hop artifacts that capture the sounds, sights and overall state of mind of the 90's underground scene in the big apple.</p><p>Some of the more notable records (from my perspective) that dropped on the label were: MF DOOM's classic debut <i><a href="https://youtu.be/TSMgjBbmjWk">Operation Doomsday</a></i>, The Juggaknots' <i><a href="https://youtu.be/g_hCDufetU4">Clear Blue Skies EP</a></i>, Siah and Yeshua Dapo's <i><a href="https://youtu.be/R2eYS5c0ZXA">The Visualz EP</a></i> and Kool Keith &amp; Godfather Don's <i><a href="https://youtu.be/O5U7ux9JzOY">Cenobites LP</a></i>.</p><p>The label also dropped LOTS of crazy 12" joints, like the Cage's <i><a href="https://youtu.be/Ir4n_-AaZT4">Agent Orange</a></i>.</p><p>Another dope bonus: Bobbito himself <a href="https://youtu.be/v3f35ah20-I">dropped random bars</a> all over the catalogue.</p><p>The label never dropped anything that wasn't dope.</p><p>Nothing but straight goods.</p><p>In fact, many of the artists who started the label branched out to other indies (like Def Jux for example) and enjoyed careers after Bobbito closed the label's doors.</p><p>If you fancy yourself a hip-hop head – especially if you're new to Fondle 'Em – I urge you to explore the label's catalogue.</p><p>I've taken the liberty of compiling (the bulk of) it for you, because Hip-Hop.</p><p>Be sure to check for the Stretch &amp; Bobbito <i><a href="http://www.stretchandbobbito.com/">Radio That Changed Lives</a></i> documentary dropping this August, which will undoubtedly explore the label in more detail.
