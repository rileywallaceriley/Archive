  <h1>Hippy Africano Drops Debut Single [Audio]</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>From the same team that's been carving a lane with the innovative artist Siimba Liives Long comes Hippy Africano, a 22-year-old Newark, New Jersey, transplant; Originally, the young rapper hails from the Ivory Coast).</p><p>The new upstart, who is currently working his debut LP, <em>Bi-Lingua Hippy</em>, is sonically a more conscious blend of Meek Mill and ScHoolBoy Q. Although he's been on the grind, we've just been blessed with his first official song, "Everybody," a not-so-subtle nod to the internal compass that leads a lot of industry rappers; "everybody wanna pop bottles, all these niggas wanna fuck models."
