-- Master P</blockquote>
The undisputed entrepreneur and southern legend Master P -- who ironically started his career on the west coast -- was already riding high by the time that 1997 rolled around.</p><p>His label No Limit, which evolved from a record store he had owned/operated in Richmond, California, was a magazine mainstay, booking out two pages at a time.</p><p>He also scored a few regional hits alongside his brothers C-Murder and Silk The Shocker, collectively known as TRU, and had some notoriety after the release of his fifth solo endeavour, <em>Ice Cream Man</em>.</p><p>It was with the release of the infamous <em>Ghetto D</em>, though, that the whole continent caught on to what the NO transplant was up to.</p><p>Fuelled by the double-platinum lead single, "Make Em' Say Ughh," the album was a game changer for not only P but his entire roster, which grew to its climax a few short years later.</p><p>The album was a rough, rugged, raw walk through  inner-city life.</p><p>From the title track, which included a vivid step-by-step manual on how to be a cocaine distributor, to the dramatic allusions to the rap industry as a form of reformation for drug dealers on "I'm A Rider." Then, there was the heartfelt  tears for the fallen on the project's second biggest single, "I Miss My Homies," which was largely inspired by the death of his brother, Kevin.</p><p>There were a few thug-love attempts -- those were, however, overshadowed by bassy funk-laced rider music that became the soundtrack of the southern massive.</p><p>Following the album's success, the label saw solo efforts by many of its core artists, like Silk and Mystikal, push millions of units.</p><p>P was even able to score Snoop Dogg during the weird limbo period after he left Death Row.</p><p>In fact, that album stands as the highest selling from the imprint.</p><p>The turn of the millennium saw the mighty tank sustain some heavy damage -- from the loss of major artists, the indefinite incarceration of C-Murder, and a decline in record sales.</p><p>P eventually sold the catalogue and has since tried to reclaim his brand's glory days a few times -- to varying degrees of success.</p><p>His son has sold millions of records, and appeared on television, and P himself still has a fortune of over $300 million to keep him warm at night.</p><p>For fans of the rapper during the heydey of his iconic label, his music will always have a place in our hearts.</p><p>As we celebrate 19 years since the release of <em>Ghetto D</em>, we've decided to take a look back at some of the album's biggest records.</p><p>Turn up, and take a walk down memory lane."Ughhhhhhh."</p></div>
