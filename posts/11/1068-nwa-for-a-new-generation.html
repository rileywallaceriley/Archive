  <h1>NWA For A New Generation</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Have you taken a look at the Billboard charts this week?</p><p>If not, don't feel bad, most people usually don't!</p><p>Well, if you did, you may have noticed some anomalies – namely the extremely high number of copies of Eazy-E, Ice Cube and Dr.Dre albums that have been moving off of (virtual) shelves since the release of the record-breaking biopic <i>Straight Outta Compton</i>.</p><p>Interesting, no one is rushing out to cop any Mc Ren solo joints, but I'll leave that alone.</p><p>How cool is that, though?</p><p>Aside from the obvious NWA sales, it's interesting to see a mix of old and new heads discovering – and rediscovering – albums like the polarizing <i><a href=" </i>Ice Cube's <i><a href=" Most Wanted</a></i>, and Eazy's <i><a href=" Duz It</a></i>, which was actually charting this week (serious – number 42!).</p><p>This movie is shining a spotlight on the expanding catalogue of the Compton institution (and its offshoots).</p><p>I'm down.</p><p>Not so much with everyone suddenly draping themselves in Raiders gear but encouraging heads to start delving into hip-hop history is golden.

It makes me hungry for the Tupac biopic by John Singleton, or perhaps a Wu-Tang flick.</p><p>How about a Gangstarr movie?</p><p>If it takes a slew of well-made Hollywood movies to keep classic back-catalogues alive for another generation, then so be it!</p><p>What ever happened to the <a href="https://youtu.be/VbcSMJgeSSY">Juice Crew movie</a>, though?</p></div>
