  <div class="meta">Fri, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>"As long as you're happy -- that's all that matters." Those are the first words we hear on the new mini-movie by Ann Arbor, MI, rapper Oneup2Lovett, <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/oneup2lovett-drops-a-new-mixtape/">whose been featured here before</a>.</p><p>It's a 14-minute journey through the eyes of the Michigan-native.</p><p>He shares his thoughts, gives insight, and provides you with a dope  amidst a lush soundtrack.</p><p>The video starts with a reflective monologue that describes not only his personal demons -- but the ills that seem to be engulphing communities and plaguing the minds of the youth.</p><p>Amidst  night time visuals, there is an intense build up that works to hammer home the internal struggle the rapper deals with.</p><p>This isn't a music video drawn out; although it does have a few prominent songs features -- but rather, an atmospheric blend of moody sounds that serve as more of a dope score than anything else.</p><p>Look, man; we've been supporting Oneup2Lovett for a minute.</p><p>The man has the skill, and "TRU" is another notch for him.</p><p>Check it out below -- and also check out the super bumping "Music," in case you missed it.</p></div>
