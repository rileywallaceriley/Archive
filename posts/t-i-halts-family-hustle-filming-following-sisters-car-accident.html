<p>The last version was published on February 19, 2019 and can be found below.]T.I. and wife Tiny have temporarily put a pin the filming for Family & Hustle After Tip’s sister, 66-year-old Precious Harris, was involved in a serious car accident in Atlanta in the early morning of Wednesday (February 13).Sources reported to TMZ crash her car into a pole, triggering an Asthma attack. She’s currently in I.C.U, and her exact condition is unknown.“I Love You Sis ... We can’t thank you enough,” Tip wrote via Instagram on Monday (February 18).An incredibly tight knit family, Tiny is also extremely close with Precious; she shared words of prayer and encouragement for her sister, noting via Instagram “Anybody that really know me knows how special & how much I cherish & love this lady ... She’s a true fighter ... always have been & God has the last word.”It seems that she may be — at the very least — stable, as T.I. was in California on Sunday (February 17) for the filming of Netflix’s hip-hop music competition series Rhythm + Flow.Harris, a mother of three, is a regular on Family & Hustle.</p>
