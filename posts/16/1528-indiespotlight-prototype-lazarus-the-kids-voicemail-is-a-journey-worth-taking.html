  <h1>#Indiespotlight: Prototype & Lazarus The Kid’s ”Voicemail” Is A Journey Worth Taking</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Duo Prototype &amp; Lazarus The Kid Just dropped a new project, and believe me, it’s worth a spin.</p><p>On a rainy day, I rode around giving this one a fair shake and was taken for more of a journey than I expected.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

The concise EP is immensely musical, with these lush, expansive musical landscapes for Prototype to literally bleed his heart out upon; there is no hyperbole in the emotion packed within these five tracks.</p><p>Atop soulful samples, energetic drum patterns, and pretty piano keys, there’s a sense of loss and sadness that lingers amongst the celebration and assertion of the dream chase.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Immediately on the heartfelt “Color,” we’re introduced to demise of a powerful relationship in Prototypes life — one which he gave his all to, and once thought would possibly end in marriage.</p><p>It’s a loss that is later encapsulated with an emotionally charged piano interlude brimming with a heavy-hearted sense of despair.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

There’s also the loss of Jason Kalinga, who is actually featured “Simba.” The second verse of “Better Way” is a letter to his lost friend, who was another powerful figure in his life.</p><p>Amongst the deep moments standing as an endearing open book into his world, there is an incredible sense of confidence; Prototype is chasing the vision in his head — and it’s hard to imagine anyone attempting to detract him from his vision after taking in this project.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Ending off with the crown jewel, “November 15,” Prototype &amp; Lazarus The Kid position themselves as exciting artists putting out music with not only a purpose<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>but a strong sense of its emotional connection.</p><p>They know what they're doing, and it’s something that hinges more on the artistic merit side of things than the trendy shit.</p><p>This isn’t for cool points, it’s a therapeutic listen made for longevity.</p><p>This is a catalog worth keeping an eye on.
