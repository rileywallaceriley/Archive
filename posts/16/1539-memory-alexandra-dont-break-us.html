  <h1>Memory Alexandra - "Don't Break Us"</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Nigerian-American singer/songwriter Memory Alexandra is a living and breathing example of the power of faith.</p><p>Her overcoming physical, verbal, and emotional abuse in her life and fully realizing -- and materializing -- her dreams is an inspiring story in itself.</p><p>Her debut album <em>Perfect</em> is a blend of different styles and elements that have this timeless feel to them -- no confining themselves to any particular trend, and refusing to be contained, but also, managing to stay connected throughout the 18-song tracklist.</p><p>So while "2 Faced Liar" has this big 90s tinged backtrack, "Connect To Me" is more of a ballad, and songs like "Found" and "Ride" have a more contemporary Hip-Hop/R&amp;B vibe to them, it all gels into a cohesive top to bottom listening experience, with Memory's powerful voice as the glue that holds it all together.

The first single from the project, "Don't Break Us," is a heartfelt plea to her partner to -- more or less -- keep the relationship intact.</p><p>The extremely engaging visual depicts her slowly catching her significant other keeping what appears to be secrets, from hiding phone calls to being sketchy about mail he's receiving; it all works to illustrate the gap building between them.</p><p>All of this comes together at the end as he eventually proposes at the video climax.</p><p>With a positive story of overcoming adversity and putting her faith in God -- and gives all of the glory and honor to her Lord and Savior Jesus Christ -- Memory Alexandra is a singer that deserves your attention.</p><p>Check out her video "Don't Break Us," above.</p></div>
