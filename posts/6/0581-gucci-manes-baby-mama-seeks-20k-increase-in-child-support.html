  <div class="meta">2018-08-27 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Gucci Mane’s baby mama Sheena Evans is demanding that child support for their son Keitheon be increased to $20,000 a month, according to a report by The Blast.In 2011, it was agreed that Evans would have primary custody.</p><p>Gucci, who was granted visitation rights, was ordered to pay $2,026 a month in child support.</p><p>This was based on his income at the time, which was roughly $24,000 a month.According to court documents, Evans claims there has been a “significant change in circumstances” since 2011.</p><p>Gucci’s $1 million wedding  — and its coinciding special that aired on BET — are among the numerous examples cited as proof of his ability to afford more than the current $2,000 rate.Evans is allegedly unable to work or go to school as their son requires a caregiver, which she can't afford.</p><p>In addition to the increase in monthly support, she's also asking Gucci to take out a $5 million life insurance policy.</p><p>As of August 27, no judgment has been made in the case.</p></div>
