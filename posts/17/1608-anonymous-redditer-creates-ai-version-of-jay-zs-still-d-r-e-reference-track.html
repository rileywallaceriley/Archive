  <h1>Anonymous Redditer Creates AI Version Of Jay-Z’s "Still D.R.E." Reference Track</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An AI-generated reference track for the iconic song "Still D.R.E." was dropped in our DMs by an anonymous Reddit user, and we knew we needed to share it.</p><p>Despite being clearly artificial, it's surprisingly cathartic to listen to.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To explain, hip-hop is aging.</p><p>Die-hard fans in their late 30s to early 40s have endured years of lore from the pre-internet era.</p><p>For example:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>There's no footage of <a href="https://youtu.be/IZ9EJLV4WhE?si=BfcJWVXJ7PvjBpy7">Biggie and 2Pac</a> freestyling at Madison Square Garden.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Nas never returned to the studio to record his remix verse for Biggie's "<a href="https://youtu.be/dvZARv4hPNs?si=x09RWQ8VmSuLbkZ9">Gimme The Loot</a>."</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>We never got the ‘<a href="https://youtu.be/j_kalpO9NH8?si=CjH_DtHwMmvKiWUM">more savage</a>’ original version of Nas' "Ether.”</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The list goes on, but the fabled reference track for "Still D.R.E.," arguably the West Coast Zeus' signature record, remains one of the most elusive. <a href="https://twitter.com/fakeshoredrive/status/1398463760558395400?lang=en">Andrew Barber</a> once tweeted, "I'd pay top dollar to hear Hov's reference track for 'Still D.R.E.' Doing both Snoop and Dre's part.</p><p>It's out there.</p><p>Somewhere."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jay-Z wrote the song for Dr.</p><p>Dre and Snoop for the 1999 album <em>2001</em>, allegedly creating a reference track where he imitated both their flows.</p><p>Snoop Dogg even revealed that Hov wrote the entire track in less than an hour.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Still D.R.E." was a commercial success, peaking at No. 93 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 30 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.</p><p>The single was certified platinum by the RIAA in 2022, signifying over 1 million units sold.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The song significantly contributed to the success of 2001, which debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and has been certified 6x platinum, selling over 6 million copies in the U.S. alone.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the original recording, if it still exists, will likely never see the light of day, the AI version oddly scratches the itch.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ethics in AI Music</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To be clear, we fundamentally oppose the exploitation of AI music.</p><p>For example, using Drake, The Weeknd, and others to create brand new songs with "original" lyrics and monetizing those records is unacceptable.</p><p>However, there's a grey area concerning reference tracks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An example would be Cipha Sounds replacing the more or less cancelled <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/cipha-sounds-uses-ai-to-replace-diddy-with-jadakiss-on-its-all-about-the-benjamins-remix-amidst-legal-issues/">Diddy on "All About The Benjamins" with Jadakiss</a>, who actually wrote the original verse.</p><p>There are also instances of AI being used for positive purposes, like reconstructing <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/still-funky-enough-interview-with-d-o-c/">The D.O.C.</a>'s original voice (from before his accident) to help him make new music.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seeing the technology used in powerful ways that don't take food off plates and simultaneously help fans fill in blank spots is as inspiring as it is inevitable.</p>
