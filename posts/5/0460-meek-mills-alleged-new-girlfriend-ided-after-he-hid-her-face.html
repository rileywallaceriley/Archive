  <h1>Meek Mill's Alleged New Girlfriend ID'ed After He Hid Her Face</h1>
  <div class="meta">2019-01-02 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Based on recent tweets, Meek Mill is in relationship mode.</p><p>When a fan suggests the Championships mastermind is in love, he replied, "I think I am."So, naturally, when he posted a picture of himself with a new boo (concealed by a smiley face emoji) on Monday (January 1), social media went nuts.As much as Meek may have wanted to keep her identity under wraps, for now, that’s not how the internet works.</p><p>It didn’t take long for The Shade Room to identify her as a woman named Janice.While a first name is hardly a full out identification, the video should be more than enough for online sleuths to crack the case.</p><p>It also (once and for all) shuts down rumors the mystery woman was Melii, an artist who appeared on his Championships LP.Meanwhile, his ex Nicki Minaj is also doing the “new boo” thing on the 'Gram, most recently posting a video of boyfriend Kenneth “Zoo” Petty kissing her feet in a hot tub.https://youtu.be/uxXWrksx9g0</p></div>
