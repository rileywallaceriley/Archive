  <h1>Timothy Dark Stands With The “Unpatriotic” Majority In His New Visual</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>New York Timothy Dark is back in the mix; he appeared on our site earlier this year with his album The Last Days Of Dark.</p><p>Now he’s back with “Unpatriotic,” a stark statement of solidarity with the frontline resistance that is standing up to Trump, his administration, and legions of supporters.

“I was reading an article about all the things the current administration had planned for the country,” he explains. “I saw a lot of people’s sad, angry and disappointed comments being met with insults and name-calling.

“They were told that all the Liberal “libtards” and “snowflakes” had no idea what they were talking about and disagreeing with the current President was “Unpatriotic” ...</p><p>I agreed with everything the people were angry about, from the immigration issues to the racist and misogynistic undertones being projected and decided I too was “Unpatriotic.“

“My current emotional state, combined with total empathy for the people, and inspiration from movies and TV shows like They Live, Kill Bill, The Matrix, X-men, The Flash, and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. would be the catalyst for both the song and the video,” he continues.</p><p>The visual is packed with a unifying call-to-action and a super cinematic treatment.</p><p>Worth a watch—no doubt!</p><p>Check it out, below.
