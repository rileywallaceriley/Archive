  <h1>Master P & Romeo Weigh In On Anthony Davis Trade: "We Got Everything"</h1>

  <div class="content"><p>It appears NBA history was made for the second time in less than a week.</p><p>On Saturday (June 15), one of the biggest trades in Los Angeles Lakers' franchise history saw the team shipping Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart -- and three first-round picks -- to the New Orleans Pelicans in exchange for Anthony Davis.The trade — aside from putting massive pressure on Davis and LeBron James to provide massive ROI — earmarks a new era for New Orleans, which is expected to select Zion Williamson for the No. 1 pick in the 2019 NBA Draft.On their way to Good Morning America, father/son duo Master P and Romeo Miller -- both New Orleans natives --  spoke to TMZ.</p><p>During their conversation, they weighed in on the epic trade and what it means for the future of the franchise."It's a win-win for everybody," Romeo said. "They got Brandon Ingram, and I think Lonzo Ball is a hell of a player.</p><p>They got Josh Hart, too.</p><p>It's like we have two Lakers teams now, Lakers and Pelicans.</p><p>They both win."When asked about whether Ball would make a perfect running mate for Williamson, Romeo noted the duo would be "a beast.""I think the Pelicans won the trade -- we got everything," Master P said later in the clip, before adding that a $20 million shoe deal for Williamson (he mentioned in a May interview) was still on the table.P also predicted joining the new era of the New Orleans Pelicans squad would be an especially good look for Ball."Coming to a place like New Orleans, we (really) love our team man, so it's a good look," he explained.Check out the full interview above.</p></div>
