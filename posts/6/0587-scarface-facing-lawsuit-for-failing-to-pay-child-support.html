  <div class="content"><p>According to an exclusive report by Bossip, Hip Hop Icon Scarface is once again in hot water for failing to pay his child support.</p><p>The Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is currently suing him on behalf of his child's mother Lisa Varner -- seeking garnished wages and a raised monthly payment.Scarface was first sued by Varner in 2011 to prove that he is, in fact, the father of the child to establish child support.</p><p>He was then ordered to pay $148 a month and an additional $30 for medical expenses.He is $6,728 in arrears, according to court papers.The latest suit isn't Facemob's first brush with child support drama.</p><p>The Geto Boy spent a short time behind bars in 2011 after it was reported that he owed upwards of $123,000 in four separate child support cases, and again in 2015 for (again) failing to pay $3,500 a month to baby mama Chana Wiley.The latter incident made massive headlines, seeing he was arrested right after getting off the BET Hip Hop Awards stage for receiving their I Am Hip Hop Award. was a learning experience, and my advice to any father out there is that if you send anything, you send it through the courts," he said in a 2012 interview with MTV, suggesting that perhaps he was paying -- but not getting credit.He seemed this echo this same sentiment after being released in 2015.</p><p>He gave a statement to AllHipHop to correct what he described as misinformation about his case.“The amount reported that was owed is inaccurate, and I had no knowledge about there being an arrest order for me," he said.To date, Scarface has not responded to the latest suit but is due in court later this month.</p></div>
