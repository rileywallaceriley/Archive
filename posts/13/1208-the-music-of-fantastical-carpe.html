An interesting artist landed in my inbox this week; Fantastical Carpé, shortened to F. Carpé made his way onto my watch list, and likely for a few reasons he didn't expect.</p><p>First some context, he's a 27-year-old devout disciple of hip-hop from Oakland, California.</p><p>He's self-produced and has a great sound that seems to draw from an eclectic blend of heads that came before him.</p><p>He credits names like Dilla, Common, Lupe, and Pharrell.</p><p>When I listen to him, though, I thought about Oakland native <a href="https://youtu.be/3Dc8I23sCeI">Saafir</a> , LA producer <a href="https://youtu.be/tQ4osAh5t4o">Madlib</a> , and his alter-ego <a href="https://youtu.be/IKphlX5XZ5k">Quasimoto</a>&amp;nbsp; with his choppy yet intricate song arrangement.</p><p>I began my trip through his Soundcloud by listening to his project <i><a href="https://soundcloud.com/fcarpe/sets">F-am</a></i>, and was enthralled with his seemingly off-the-head style at certain points, the sometimes sporadic/ jarring beats with obscure samples woven in, and the overall structure.</p><p>Tracks like the Beatles sampled "Money," the jazzy "Love Machine," and the standout "The Family," really show off what he's capable off.
<blockquote>Hip-Hop is my way of expressing the things that I can’t always articulate.</p><p>It’s poetry for the soul."

Some tracks that you should use to "introduce yourself" to his sound is the über soulful "Yes I," and "Workin," which seems to be a staple of his live sets.</p><p>Start there, and see where it goes -- he has lots to explore.</p><p>The more I tried to put my finger on it, he reminds me of MF DOOM; not to say that he conceals his identity in any way, but similar to the villain on his pre-Madvillain gem <a href="https://youtu.be/xOYkjt9F81c">MM...Food</a>, he takes chances.</p><p>His music as a whole has a certain weirdness to it, which when played as a collection has numerous moments of gritty brilliance.</p><p>He's very much a "method to the madness" type of artist.</p><p>This is headphone music for real heads -- I'm talking music lovers who like to float on clouds, bump dusty jazz loops, and give local and underground artists a chance.</p><p>So put on your Raiders cap,  put on F. Carpé, and let it ride while you spend the afternoon cruising in the sunshine.</p><p>Hit his <a href="https://soundcloud.com/fcarpe/sets">Soundcloud</a>.</p><p>Early
