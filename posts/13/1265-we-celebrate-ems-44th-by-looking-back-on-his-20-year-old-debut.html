  <h1>We Celebrate Em's 44th By Looking Back On His 20 Year Old Debut</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Today rapper Marshall Mathers, aka Eminem, turns 44 years old.</p><p>With all of his success, his ultra-shock-value raps, over the top beef, and straight up genius-level pen game, it's easy to forget his pre-slim shady gem, Infinite.</p><p>Before the Dr.</p><p>Dre cosigns, before Shady records, before the <a href="https://youtu.be/nqV5zLqr2so">Rap Olympics </a>-- Em was a tongue-twisting emcee fully immersed in the early 90s  hip-hop.</p><p>His first project, <i>Infinite</i>, officially labeled as an EP, was (for those that missed it), a stark departure from the uninhibited, at times brutally raw (and humorous) Slim Shady that most fans fell in love with.</p><p>Production wise, the project was put together by D12 member Mr.</p><p>Porter and the late Proof.</p><p>The sound was -- for the most part -- cohesive and clean, and very much reflective of the era.</p><p>Em was, as he described, "still figuring himself out." Lyrically, he was a beast on this project, although the subject matter and actual flow/delivery weren't yet the Em we got to know later on.</p><p>He was widely criticized for sounding a lot like AZ, which was accurate (to a degree).</p><p>His songs seemed to have a more optimistic output on life in general.</p><p>He wasn't yet a father, and clearly still was still in love with Kim, who we all famously know as the woman he and Haley threw in the river on the morbidly entertaining "<a href="https://youtu.be/UiZ10PFD_04">Just The Two Of Us</a>." This album introduced us to a hungry 24-year old come-up rapper who wanted to pop off and give his girl(s) a better life.</p><p>The only semblance of uber imaginative pseudo-Shady-esque rhyme schemes was on the record "<a href="https://youtu.be/iiEo9NT9t_w">Backstabber</a>." There are gems here, and bars for days -- and maybe weeks.</p><p>The album has received a great deal of praise in hindsight, although it was widely shit on -- for lack of a better term -- by music journalists at the time.</p><p>The failure led Em to take a more aggressive tone in his music.</p><p>Sidebar, his 'new style' was infamously challenged by rapper <a href="https://youtu.be/ZFvK480HAx0">Cage, who claimed Em bit his whole steeze</a>.</p><p>There was an ensuing beef, which Eminem pretty much bodied with a line on his record "<a href="https://youtu.be/ubEublECnMU">Role Model</a>": "I bought Cage's tape, opened it and dubbed over it." I digress, though.</p><p>The EP stands as a significant slice of hip-hop history; it is probably more accurate to take it as an early demo rather than a debut, as it was the precursor to one of hip-hop's most revered names, and consistent top 5 DOA resident.</p><p>As we wish Em a happy born day, let's take a spin down memory lane and bump his classic intro to the game; it turns 20 this year!
