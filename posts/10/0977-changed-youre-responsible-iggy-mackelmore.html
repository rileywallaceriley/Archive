  <h1>We Changed: Why You're Responsible for Iggy And Macklemore</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sat, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>It's no secret that I'm a real hip-hop head.</p><p>I was born in the early 80's, and I grew up in the 90's surrounded by what I consider to be the best of hip-hop as a genre – and I feel that it (for the most part) still is.</p><p>With that in mind, I'll now proceed to finally weigh in on the whole Iggy vs the world conversation.</p><p>Is she a deep thinker who makes the thoughtful, well-written brand of hip-hop I love?</p><p>No.</p><p>For that reason, I don't consume it.</p><p>So much so, that it's almost unfair for me to analyze it.</p><p>What we can say with certainty though, is that her fans buy it.</p><p>They shower her with undying adoration, buy tickets to her shows and (violently) defend her honour 140 characters at a time.</p><p>When is the last time you did any of that for your favourite artists?
<blockquote>Instead of tweeting about how much you hate her , perhaps you can tweet about the latest record by Skyzoo or D'Angelo?</blockquote>
Music is a business, which means it's a for profit outfit that enjoys generating return on investment.</p><p>There was a time when artists we worship and consider architects were in expensive studios recording big budget projects, because that's what we wanted.</p><p>That's right – we were <em>actually</em> going to stores and buying their shit, packing up their shows, etc.</p><p>That all stopped though; albeit it was kind of gradual.</p><p>Nowadays people love to scream about how hip-hop isn't <em>real</em> – but didn't purchase Sadat X's past release, or rush out to support that latest Craig G effort.</p><p>You catch my drift?</p><p>Hip-Hop changed, but so did it's core of paying customers.</p><p>My hypothesis is that we grew up – let's face it, nobody young is that upset about any of this.</p><p>It's us real heads who watched hip-hop grow from nothing into a feared outcry from black America.</p><p>We watched as the highest powers tried – and failed miserably – to silence hip-hop.</p><p>We're the ones who are mad that the thing we loved is being perverted into this corporate behemoth that appears to be shutting us out.</p><p>That isn't hip-hop though.</p><p>There I said it.</p><p>All that shit we're protesting is about as hip-hop as Vanilla Ice, MC Hammer, PM Dawn, etc.</p><p>Wack hip-hop <em>irregardless</em> of race, has long sold millions and been awarded Grammys and AMAs.</p><p>Hip-Hop is a culture, and it still thrives (in its purest form) today – but it needs our help.</p><p>Are you mad that corporate America (i.e a group of old white people with suits) is allowing (for the most part) talentless rich kids take over the thing you love?</p><p>Why not support the hundreds of real artists out there?</p><p>Why don't we all band together and support all the artists who are preserving the culture?</p><p>Why don't we stop just sitting around and actually make a change?</p><p>Hip-hop was born an underdog, so going against the <em>machine</em> really shouldn't be something that scares us.</p><p>In an attempt to round back, I'll say that Iggy Azalea is a cog in the machine.</p><p>None of this is her fault.</p><p>She is making music, and people are buying it – it's supply and demand and it's the way business works.</p><p>TI is no worse than Akon, who brought us Lady Gaga and Usher, who brought us Bieber.</p><p>Instead of tweeting about how much you hate her, perhaps you can tweet about the latest record by Skyzoo or D'Angelo?</p><p>Just saying.
