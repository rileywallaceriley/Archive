  <h1>Mase Vs. Cam’ron: For The Culture</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>This past weekend gave 90s heads a reason to be excited; Harlem-legends Ma$e and Cam'ron went toe-to-toe is a full-on rap beef complete with vicious person jabs and insidious claims.</p><p>But, was it all for the clicks?</p><p>Their cordial agreeance to disagree and move forward via text (which Cam shared) seems to suggest it was all in good fun -- or was it Ma$e being jabbed for far too long?</p><p>To appreciate the magnitude of the beef, it's vital to understand the actual history these guys have; this wasn't bullshit Twitter beef with a stranger.</p><p>Both Cam and  Ma$e were members of the often under-celebrated Harlem-based group Children Of The Corn, which included Herb McGruff, Cam's cousin Bloodshed, and the late icon Big L. The group recorded roughly 30 tracks, but were largely derailed as a collective by the death of bloodshed and L. However, by the time that L was murdered in 1999, all the group's members had signed solo-deals and ventured out on their own.

Ma$e was -- without question -- the most successful by the time 1998 rolled around.</p><p>His debut, <i>Harlem World</i>, topped charts and to date has gone 4-times platinum.</p><p>It was his label situation with Bad Boy that helped Cam link with Biggie Smalls, who consequently facilitated him inking a deal with  Lance "Un" Rivera "Un" Rivera.</p><p>Ma$e also appeared on Cam's first breakout single "Horse &amp; Carriage," and appeared in his visual for “357.”

Fast-forward to 1999, Ma$e retired from rapping to become a Christian pastor.</p><p>The circumstances surrounding his departure from Harlem (and Hip Hop) were murky for years.</p><p>The official story that we've come to accept is that Uptown-resident Baby Maine (cousin of incarcerated rapper Max B) ran Ma$e out of Harlem for having relations with his girl.</p><p>It is captured in the song "Jealous Guy," which Maine saw as extremely disrespectful.</p><p>So whether or not he was fully committed, the "finding God" angle was a front of sorts.

Now, Cam and Ma$e go way back -- even playing basketball together in High School, but Cam and the Dipset crew have openly talked about Ma$e for years.</p><p>On wax, you can go back to Cam's biggest album, Come With Me.</p><p>He spits the following bars on "I Just Wanna" about Ma$e's sudden departure: "I just want him to know/rock them jewels, flash that chrome/It's all good, you can come back home if you want."

That was the nicer acknowledgment.</p><p>In fact, some of their public comments had been less than flattering; Cam was pretty loose on Instagram Live earlier this year, basically calling a spade a spade, eliciting a response from Ma$e.</p><p>Most recently, Cam dropped some pretty vicious bars on the opening verse of "It's Killa" on <i>The Program</i>:

"Then I watched him play Pop Lotti against Baby Maine/ At this time I'm moving heroin in Maryland/ They both died, and this nigga turned reverand/ Had the hood hot, FBI and agents 'round/ We need a referee, shit, that shit a flagrant foul."

That brings us to "The Omen," and Cam's (kind of disappointing) "Dinner Time." The fans of us here at AAHH have concluded Ma$e was a clear winner, but -- in all actuality -- Hip Hop won.</p><p>In a week that also saw a new project from Fabolous and Jadakiss, NYC seems to be on a pretty nice run right now.</p><p>Though neither of these artists is in any state that we could consider a prime, It had heads glued to the net in a fashion similar to the way heads were glued to Hot 97 awaiting a response record in the epic Nas and Jay-Z beef.

As a 30-something-year-old who got on to Children Of The Corn before these two dropped their other shit -- I believe it was on a Stretch &amp; Bobbito tape I copped as a kid -- this battle was something special for me.</p><p>I knew that the "dirt" they had on each other would be extremely deep, and as a whole, I wasn't disappointed.</p><p>I found myself saying "what a time to be alive" no less than 16 times in the past 48 hours.</p><p>While the preview for Cam's response included mention of the fact <i>The Program 2</i> is dropping January 1st (making this all seem like a commercial), I still loved it -- for the culture.</p><p>Ma$e is often written off as a corny rapper, but his shit when quadruple platinum.</p><p>We all fucked with his music pretty heavy, is tbh <i>Harlem World</i> holds up 20 years later.</p><p>There is plenty of chatter centered on irrelevance, which is sad.</p><p>These two came up in an era when shit was analog -- no internet, no steams.</p><p>Just straight up physical sales.</p><p>Most newer (urban) artists will never know what it feels like sell four million full-length albums.</p><p>Not singles, ALBUMS.</p><p>I for one am happy that these cats are still out here.</p><p>As for Ma$e, even if he fades back into obscurity, at least he can go out with his head a little higher than the last time he dipped.</p></div>
