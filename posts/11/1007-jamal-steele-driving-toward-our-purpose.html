– Jamal STEELE</blockquote>

Support the underground.</p><p>A lot of heads are scared to jam unknown acts, but if my time as a writer has taught me anything, it's that an open mind can expose your soul to some serious gems.</p><p>The Hollis Queens duo Run DMC were the the documented inspiration for many golden era acts, including legendary rapper Notorious BIG – and Atlanta-based rapper Jamal STEELE is no different.</p><p>After seeing the visuals for their smash crossover hit Walk This Way, with Aerosmith, Jamal knew that hip-hop was something he had to do.</p><p>He describes his career as a mission to "Impart, Influence, &amp; Inspire" – sounds a little contrived right?</p><p>See that's the dope thing about this brother.</p><p>It Isn't at all!</p><p>He's extremely genuine.</p><p>He gave me a copy of his semi-autobiographical new project Driving Toward Our Purpose, and I have to say, I was impressed.</p><p>I'm always supportive of cats who not only care about bars, but take the time to create cohesive, intelligent projects, rather than "choppy piecework".</p><p>I will pre-face this review by admitting that I'm a bit ignorant to his full catalogue, but I'm working my way through it.</p><p>So here's the goods: the album is sonically crafted by GlassC!ty, El-R, Ant Carter, DJ Quezs, Ta-Ku – a name that instantly peaked my interest –and Jamal STEELE himself.</p><p>It's 10 tracks, and has no filler or interludes.</p><p>The album starts with the hard-hitting Let It Go, where he he airs out clowns on the mic, and asserts the tone for the rest of the project.</p><p>Some of the standouts for me were the "be yourself" anthem Do You, spiritual assertion Love Manifesto, the super lyrical Out There and the super soulful December Rain.</p><p>Jamal wears his heart in his sleeve: this album sees him sharing not only a healthy dose of well thought out social commentary and life experience, but also his faith.</p><p>It's a very honest, humble listen.</p><p>I'm always drawn to cats who exist among radio, BET, MTV – and so on – and still manage to make a viable, non-commercial brand of hip-hop.</p><p>Not to say that he doesn't want to "blow-up", he just isn't dumbing himself down to do it.</p><p>Salute.</p><p>Jamal is currently unsigned, but he's definitely worth a listen.</p><p>You can stream his Driving Toward Our Purpose project below, and you can also check him on
