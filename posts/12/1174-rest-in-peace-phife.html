  <h1>Rest In Peace Phife</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>This morning as I woke up -- sort of -- for a (brief) few minutes, my wife broke the news to me: Phife, of A Tribe, Called Quest, had passed.</p><p>His cause of death was not immediately disclosed, although, as intimately disclosed in their Michael Rapaport produced documentary, he had in the past suffered kidney failure and required a transplant to survive.</p><p>It's likely that his death was the result of complications of diabetes, a condition that also claimed the life of my biological father.</p><p>His passing hits me -- and I assume most hip-hop heads -- quite hard.</p><p>I consider A Tribe Called Quest to be my favourite group of all time.</p><p>That's not just something I say, either.</p><p>I walked into a store at the age of 11 and purchased <i>Low-End Theory</i> on Cassette, and often consider <i>Midnight Marauders</i>, the second album I ever purchased on CD, to be amongst my most treasured.</p><p>The Tribe have been a mainstay in my life, and the passing of Phife closes a chapter in hip-hop that many of us never wanted to close.</p><p>Phife was a true emcee and a living/breathing testament to everything we loved about New York/Eastcoast hip-hop in the 90's.&amp;nbsp;

It's a beautiful thing that he was able to patch up his differences with Q-Tip, though.</p><p>The fact that he was able to reunite, as recently as November, to perform classics, and celebrate the 25 year legacy of the group is a magical thing that Phife got to experience, and that we -- as fans -- got to see him experience.</p><p>I can proudly say that I saw A Tribe Called Quest (in their entirety) live in concert, and will treasure the moment forever.</p><p>He leaves behind a legacy that will never tarnish; Phife will always remain a timeless figure in the foundation of the culture us purists hold dear.</p><p>Prayers and condolences to his family -- and peace to the Zulu Nation.
