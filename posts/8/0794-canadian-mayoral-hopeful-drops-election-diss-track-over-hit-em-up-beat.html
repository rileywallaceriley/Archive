  <h1>Canadian Mayoral Hopeful Drops Election Diss Track Over "Hit Em' Up" Beat</h1>
  <div class="meta">2017-11-03 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>The race for mayor in Montreal, Quebec is heating up, and candidate Tyler Lemco -- a YouTuber and former member of the web show Epic Meal Time -- just took things to a whole other level.Over 2Pac's iconic instrumental for "Hit Em Up," the mayoral hopeful dropped a diss track aimed squarely at the city's current mayor, Denis Coderre, who was elected in 2013.Rocking Timberland boots, Lemco flames the mayor about everything from the way he spends money to his weight.</p><p>He also is seen holding a pitbull -- a breed of a dog currently banned in the city -- by the leash, which is a nod to the fact that overturning the ban is one of his platform points.It should be noted this isn't the first hint of savagery he's shown toward the current mayor."I'm hoping that this starts a trend," Lemco tells HipHopDX. " rather than debates, we could have battle raps as part of the electoral process."After months of campaigning, Lemco notes that he's been trying to do things outside of the box.</p><p>As he describes it, he's been approaching things with an entertainer's mindset."I'm not a fan of the current mayor," he admits. "I've been rapping for 15 years, and I figured this would be a good idea."One part that stands out is the last bar where he notes that Valérie Plante -- a city councilor also running for mayor -- is pretty cool."When I first told  I was running about a year ago, he just laughed," he says. "He's never been very nice to me.</p><p>Valérie Plante, though, has reached out to me at least a dozen times on Social Media.</p><p>She's still the opponent, and I don't want to talk her up too much, but she's a really nice lady."According to recent numbers from CBC, Lemco doesn't have a chance on election day (November 5), although Plante is leading Coderre by 2 percent.He says his lack of experience when it comes to the political realm is one of the qualities that would make him a great mayor."I would come in with a regular person mentality of what the city needs ...</p><p>I think I would be a good breath of fresh air.</p><p>A blank slate," he says.Check out the full diss track above.</p></div>
