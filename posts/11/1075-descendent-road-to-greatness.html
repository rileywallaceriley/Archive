<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Raleigh, North Carolina has seen it's share of (hip-hop) talent over the years.</p><p>Artists like the almighty J.Cole, and backpack-rap demi-gods Little Brother have roots in the "city of oaks".</p><p>I'd like to introduce you all to a new voice hailing the city – Descendent. <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/unsigned-hype-descendent/">I featured this brother</a> a while back in the #UnsignedHype section but wanted to delve a little deeper into his work. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">His debut album, <em>Road to Greatness: Journey of a Lost Soul</em>, is an excellent body of work.</p><p>It's an an eclectic mix of bassy trap sounds on songs like <em>Road To the Future</em> and <em>Break The Cycle</em>, 90's boom bap on songs like <em>Too Easy</em> and <em>Trouble</em>, and soulful hip-hop beats on songs like <em>I'm Ready</em> and <em>Soul</em> – which almost brings to mind the early work of hometown hero 9th Wonder.</p><p>The mixture of sounds is very organic, which makes it hard to pinpoint if he's "stronger" when concentrating on one particular sound.</p><p>Nothing sounds forced – and although he switches up the sonic-sub genre, he never wavers from his message or personal style/flow.</p><p>He’s honest, insightful, and very real.</p><p>He focuses on positive messages, stories of struggle, determination and moral-filled lyrics that paint a very clear picture of who he is as a person – and an artist. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">His dedication to his craft – and values – is best summed in the two skits on the project.</p><p>In the second last one, which is a preamble to the album closer <em>Soul</em>, he’s told he should “live the life” and make a more commercially viable brand of hip-hop.</p><p>He responds only with, “ I don’t want to be another lost soul.” This sentiment is expressed throughout <em>Road to Greatness: Journey of a Lost Soul</em>.</p><p>For a debut project, it's exceptionally polished and self-aware.</p><p>Descendent is one to keep an eye on. </span></p>
