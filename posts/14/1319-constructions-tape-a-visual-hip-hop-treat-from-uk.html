  <h1>Constructions Tape: A Visual Hip-Hop Treat From UK</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>The UK trio of We'll See, Treece and producer Hyro--collectively known as SWMS--started 2017 off with an exciting new project, <em>Constructions Tape</em>.</p><p>The 11 track project is packed with lo-fi hip-hop goodness, grimy underground production (with a few exceptions like "La tristesse durera toujours" and "SNES CD"), and a whole lot of bars.</p><p>They also take it a step further, with a visual version of the album; reminiscent of infamous visual albums like Streets Is Watching--albeit with less of a linear story line.</p><p>A year's worth of blood sweat and tears, the project is a fantastic dig among the sea of stuff floating the net.</p><p>Records like the eerie sounding "D13 KRU" have an aesthetic that could have dropped from a dubbed Stretch &amp; Bob tape from '95, while the trappish vibe of "SNES-CD" and the "Interlude" provide a contemporary feel.</p><p>While there is an obvious 90s East Coast hip-hop influence here, Constructions Tape remains fresh--and incredibly polished.</p><p>It isn't rushed and doesn't conform to what's "popping" which gives it more of a timeless appeal.</p><p>A bit of poking around, and you'll find these guys have a ton of material out there.</p><p>This is a dope project, though.</p><p>Give it a spin and tell a friend--you're welcome!</p></div>
