  <h1>Bruh, Do Blogs Even Matter?</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>In a brief but searing Twitter rant, young artist Russ, who — let me be clear — is incredibly dope, had some less than flattering things to say about Hip Hop blogs.</p><p>After being what he perceived as stonewalled on his epic come up by "pompous" writers, he now is vehemently spreading a simple message: blogs don't matter.</p><p>As a writer, it obviously rubbed me the wrong way.</p><p>More importantly, though, it made me stop and consider the reasons I even do this.</p><p>I've been in love with writing since a child.</p><p>Although I've dabbled as an artist — which you can explore if you're interested — I've always been fascinated with Hip Hop journalism, and am fortunate to be in a position to contribute to some of the most respected sites in the game.</p><p>Why do I do it?</p><p>I love having critical conversations about "art," which is what I view Hip Hop is; but more than that, I love to share stories.</p><p>I love to research, discover and share stories that hopefully put you on to elements/angles of the music you're listening to that perhaps you didn't consider.</p><p>I also like to shine a light on music that maybe you haven't caught on to yet.</p><p>I'm a storyteller; I'm a curator, I'm a creative.</p><p>I'm not necessarily a make or break platform for artists.</p><p>My nod or approval doesn't necessarily equate to an artist's success.</p><p>It does, though, often create compelling conversations, and give their built in fans something to enjoy.</p><p>Is it my job to show love to every single artist that exists?</p><p>No.</p><p>Russ, like many artists before him, was stuffing writer's inboxes, and — back in 2014 — was spazzing on them for not responding in a timely fashion.</p><p>Even though he did get mad love at a point.</p><p>However, Russ did make it, and his debut broke the top 10 Billboard 200, without blog support.</p><p>Much like G4shi, <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/indie-af-rapper-hi-rez-grinds-his-way-into-itunes-charts/">Hi-Rez</a>, and other artists who have been building massive followings under the radar — systematically and organically.</p><p>Does his success mean that blogs don't matter?</p><p>Well, no.</p><p>Not quite.</p><p>For every 3 Russes, there are thousands of artists who find new audiences and expand their industry — and social — credibility using blogs and curated online Hip Hop platforms.</p><p>Also, consider the relationship between writers, PR, management, and labels.</p><p>To a degree, shunning media is shunning a great faction of the industry.</p><p>Russ, and his like-minded peers, are entitled to their thoughts on the credibility and usefulness of blogs — and writers — but don't generalize and put us in a box because you perhaps didn't catch the ear or imagination of the contacts you reached to.</p><p>Speaking for myself, I put my heart and soul into contributing to the culture and lending my pen in support of good music.</p><p>Can I live ?

(BTW, Russ' album is fire.)</p></div>
