  <div class="content"><p>California-bred artist Preme turned down scholarships to many top Ivy League schools to dedicate his life to his passion--music.</p><p>Referencing himself as a songwriter first and a performer second, he defines his style as R&amp;B infused with a kaleidoscope of genres such as Rock, Soul, and Hip-Hop.</p><p>Currently, Preme Writez is making appearances and playing shows in support of his latest album THE WOOD, which includes the singles "Hello, Hello" and "FairyTales." The latter, "FairyTales," was recognized by members of the Recording Academy and placed on the Official 59th Annual Grammy Ballot for "Best R&amp;B Performance." No biggie!</p><p>His two latest visuals, "Fasho" and "It's Too Easy," are impressive with well over 20,000 hits each in less than a week.</p><p>Give them both a spin and get up on Preme!</p><p>Early.</p></div>
