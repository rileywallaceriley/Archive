  <div class="content"><p>Lil Wayne's oft-delayed album Tha Carter V is finally going to see the light of day.</p><p>According to a new Billboard cover story, the LP's intro is set to kick things off on a somber -- yet extremely timely -- note.Billboard's Dan Rys noted details of the album remained scant throughout the interview.</p><p>But as the conversation drew to a close, Wayne proceeded to preview a song in which he admits that he shot himself at the age of 12, it was actually a suicide attempt in response to his mother forbidding him to rap.Wayne had long described the incident as an accident stemming from him playing with a gun.“He just told me one day that he was ready to address it now,” longtime friend -- and acting Young Money President -- Mack Maine noted. “ ‘I want to talk about this because I know a lot of people out here might be going through that.’” track reportedly samples Sampha's 2013 song “Indecision.”With the delayed LP set to see the light of day, Wayne reflected on what he found to be the most frustrating part of his very public dispute with Birdman.“The difficult part of it was finally having to pull the curtains back and see what the hell was out that window -- having to actually care about other things than my music and my lyrics," Wayne said.Wayne also addressed the special role his children play in his life and revealed a new stance on retirement."I do think about retirement ...</p><p>I think about how I don’t think I ever will," he says.Read the full interview here.</p></div>
