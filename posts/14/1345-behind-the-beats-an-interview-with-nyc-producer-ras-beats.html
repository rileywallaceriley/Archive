  <h1>Behind The Beats: An Interview With NYC Producer Ras Beats</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>There's one thing to love and admire the golden era and draw influence from it while incorporating it into contemporary sounds, and then there's having lived it—and building/adding to a sound that never truly died.</p><p>Enter Ras Beats, a producer who's making some of the hottest underground New York flavors out right now; he's just getting started.</p><p>He has a track record of dropping some super flame singles on his imprint, but 2016's <i>Control Your Own</i> is his first full-body of work, and it features an impressive cast of rappers, including Elzhi, Roc Marciano, Masta Ace, Sadat X, and more.</p><p>Ras had a <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/ras-beats-interview/">Q&amp;A with AAHH </a>last year when the project dropped but linked up with is again recently to chat about his past, his motivation, and what's next.</p><p>Check out the interview below, and if you've been sleeping on <i>Control Your Own</i>——wake up!



<b>Your music is very nineties hip hop.</p><p>Have you been doing it since that era?</b>

Yep, I have.</p><p>I spit out the first record on my label in 2003, and I was at it before that.</p><p>I was doing stuff in the nineties.</p><p>It's a tradition I follow, but I always tell people, I try to add on to it, make something new out of something that came before what I do, so that's it.</p><p>Yeah, I've been doing it for a minute.

<b>What keeps you motivated?</p><p>Because you're completely not following the wave at all—what makes you go that route, and keep it so traditional?</b>

Making music to me, it just comes organically.</p><p>A lot of times, I'm listening to a record, and all of a sudden, I'm like, 'yeah, I'm going to start messing with this right now.' I kind of just go by stuff that I would like to hear.</p><p>To me, there are trends that come and go, but I've figured out what I think I'm good at, so I try to keep working on that, keep getting better at what I do, and not worry about trends.</p><p>Trends come and go, so I feel like there's going to be a time the grittier production style might be a little more in fashion than it is right now.</p><p>I'm just doing what I do, and sticking to what I think I'm good at, and really working on that part of the craft.

<b>Do you see a shift in the industry more towards your style?</p><p>Because I do, in a way.</p><p>There's a lot of younger artists coming in that are jumping on it.</b>

Yeah, to me, it's like with listening to music--from doing production&amp;nbsp;to digging--I listen to all kinds of shit.</p><p>I'm wide open.</p><p>I listen to anything, and if I feel it, I feel it.</p><p>But with hip hop, I like different styles, but I like it to have a little bit of grit&amp;nbsp;and be authentic to whoever makes it.</p><p>If you're an MC or a producer, and you just follow what everybody else is doing, you might still make some good stuff, but a lot of times you don't, because you're just doing a carbon copy of what everybody else is doing.</p><p>Sometimes it comes to a point that people are like, I want to hear some stuff that's <em>you</em>.</p><p>I think that's what happened with Alicia Keys, just to switch to another style of music.</p><p>Artists like that, people were starving for somebody who wrote her own songs, played the piano, sung her heart out, so it was lacking that authenticity.</p><p>So, I think that style in most of my production has been around, but definitely getting more attention now than it has in the last couple years for sure.</p><p>I definitely agree with you on that.

<b>What have been some of your highlights so far? </b>

Personally, the highlight for me was the album.</p><p>It's the biggest piece of work that I put together myself, and I took my time with it.</p><p>Before that, there was a single I actually put on the album as well with Master Ace and Sadat X, that was a big highlight for me..</p><p>A couple of lesser known records that I put out on my label as well that just meant a lot to me personally, but definitely the album so far.</p><p>Most definitely.</p><p>Not even close, that's the biggest piece of music for sure.

<b>What are some of the other things that you're putting out on your label?</p><p>Do you have artists on your label?</b>

Yeah.</p><p>There's a guy on <em>Control Your Own</em>&amp;nbsp;named JBiz who was on two tracks; the first record I put out with him, was a song called "Ninety Five" that we put out in 2003, which did well.</p><p>That was the strictly vinyl era, so we made some noise with it back then.</p><p>That was a dope thing, and goes back quite a bit.</p><p>That was the first thing we put out.</p><p>I put out an EP also in 2006 that was vinyl, and we did some digital with it.</p><p>That was five songs, and JBiz was actually on it too.</p><p>I did a song too with Neek The Exotic who's down with Large Professor and stuff a couple years ago, and that was pretty dope.</p><p>That was on his previous album, too.</p><p>And then I've done a lot of under the radar stuff, so I'm trying to be on the radar these days.</p><p>That's what I'm trying to do now .</p><p>I'm trying to focus on that part.

<b>So, what are some of the things you're working on now?</p><p>Because the last couple times we were trying to connect you were in the studio.</p><p>What do you have in the pipeline?</b>

I'm in the early phase of the next project--it's going to be me and one MC.</p><p>I'm almost ready to let it out of the bag, but I'm still keeping it under wraps because I don't want to say anything until it's official.</p><p>Also, I've been doing a lot of stuff for different people—a joint here, a joint there—and some of that should start coming out in like March and April!</p></div>
