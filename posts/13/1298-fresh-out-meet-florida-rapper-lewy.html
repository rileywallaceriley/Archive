  <h1>Fresh Out: Meet Florida Rapper Lewy</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><blockquote>"I realized I wanted to do this for the rest of my life." --Lewy</blockquote>
Lewy—a senior at UFC with a major in pre-med—has recently taken to rapping; "If rapping does not work out for me, I will continue to pursue being a surgeon." The young rapper stood out because he didn't come off as less than a month fresh; in actually, his high-quality videos put him ahead of many of the submissions we get around here.</p><p>We decided to give young Lewy some shine—peep the quick Q&amp;A below, and of you're feeling him, mash on the share button.



<b>You're new to the game, right?</b>

Yeah, I started rapping a few weeks ago; because I was tired of being broke and that's where the money is at.

<b>Where are you from?</b>

My hometown is Orlando, Florida and I love my city to death.

<b>So, tell me about your music.</b>

The type of music I make is the type that people can vibe to and blast in their car.</p><p>I would say that I am versatile, as I have club bangers, trap music, freestyles, and emotional songs.

<b>What made you want to rap?</b>

I've always had a passion for music—ever since I could remember.</p><p>I never really thought I enjoyed it to an extent where I thought I would be making it, though.</p><p>It wasn't until a couple of weeks ago when I started writing music and getting feedback from my fans that I realized I wanted to do this for the rest of my life.

<b>Who or what are your major influences?</b>

I think the only influence that I have is seeing people play  music and enjoy it.

<b>What have you dropped so far?</b>

I have released four songs so far: "Bout It, No Fake Friends, It's Okay," and "Bust It Open." I am currently working on a track with Drebo , a Palm Beach native, that will be released towards the end of this month.</p><p>Also, I am working on my debut mixtape: Panties, Bologna, and Cheese: Part 1.</p><p>I came up with the title randomly, I swear; but, it will be released in January.

<b>What are your goals?</p><p>What are younhooing to achieve?</b>

Having only just started rapping, I think it's amazing that people like my music and not to mention my music videos—shout out to my cameraman Brian Mafuz (YMDMP).</p><p>Overall, my goals in the industry are just to be able to make a living off rapping and being able to live comfortable.</p><p>That includes taking care of my family and my friends.

<b>Where do you go from here?</b>

The next step for me is just to get my name out in the industry as much as possible—and as fast as possible.</p><p>Once I blow up, everything will be easy from there in my opinion.</p></div>
