  <h1>Review: Meyhem Lauren & DJ Muggs’ ”Members Only” Is A Bite-Sized Banger</h1>
  <div class="meta">2019-09-10 — reviews</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Although rapper Meyhem Lauren may have spent the earlier part of his career as a perpetual best man to Action Bronson, he has more than come into his own over the past few years/releases.Following up this summer’s Nickel Plated Wordplay, a collaborative EP with producer Nickel Plated, he blessed fans on Friday (September 5), teasing a proper follow up to 2018’s Frozen Angels EP with a new Muggs produced four-pack titled Members Only.As no surprise to anyone, the tenured duo go together like peanut butter and jelly, albeit fans are likely to find this effort too short.</p><p>Even though Frozen Angels was an EP, it still delivered eight songs.</p><p>The sequencing and loose thematic arc created by the sampled interludes make it feel solid, though still just an appetizer — especially since the video for ”Wavy” was already floating around prior to the release.https://youtu.be/zNz0RsHx-1oAll four of the songs have the same aesthetic per se, but ultimately a different vibe. “Blue Chinese” for example has a slightly off-kilter drum pattern, leading Mayhem to drop a more choppy rhyme pattern, which works, but is slightly out of pocket.“Wavy” definitely has a knock to it, but the minimalism of “GT3,” with its chunky bass licks layered over a crispy drum loop, guides Mayhem’s pen for what stands out as the shiniest pebble in the pond.https://youtu.be/i0h5Kofk_mgStill, like most projects in this new post-Griselda era, the bodies of work are strongest as just that, full bodies.</p><p>Not that singles are irrelevant, but (in this case) nothing here stands out as an enduring hit in any way.</p><p>Nonetheless, it’s a hearty helping of Muggs’ brand of boom-bap and Meyhem’s braggadocio-laced bars that bleed the borough of Queens.More importantly, it’s a taste of what the two may have percolating in the cannon.</p><p>Whether we’ll be getting something on par with Frozen Angels or an undeniable masterpiece like their first collaboration Gems from the Equinox remains to be seen.</p></div>
