  <h1>My Top Records of 2016</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>2016 has been a crazy year for music; and, with a gross political divide and draining presidential campaign in the US, it was much appreciated.</p><p>There were lots of huge projects this year, and an almost daunting amount of content that passed across my desk over the last 365, but I managed to narrow it down to the top 10 albums that graced my headphones.</p><p>Honourable mention to J Cole's <em>4 Your Eyez Only</em>, which more than lived up to the hype.</p><p>If you didn't give these albums a fair shake, fire up Apple Music and press play!

<strong>Meek Mill — <em>DC4</em></strong>

DC4 has crazy production, a-game contributions from the likes of Quavo, Thugger, Pusha T, and the late Lil’ Snupe — along with French Montana — on the mixtape Outro.</p><p>If you didn’t like Milly before, you probably wouldn’t like him now, but I’m not sure he cares.</p><p>For those who either have been fans for a minute or are impartial in all the alienating and distracting non-music nonsense, DC4Life is a dope listen. <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/dc4-is-flames/">Check out my full review here</a>.

<strong>ScHool Boy Q — <em>Blank Face</em></strong>

Q is the product of the California sun-kissed, gang-ridden streets — and that always comes across in his music.</p><p>But he’s also made it out and is in a position where he’s making serious cash alongside the biggest crew in the game.</p><p>He’s making  world a better place for his daughter to grow up in. <em>Blank Face</em> is a lot of the same old ScHoolboy you’ve come to love — but with a dose of newfound retrospective  sentiment in the mix.</p><p>All in all, he’s made his growth apparent; It’s an excellent sequel to a noteworthy debut. <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/schoolboy-q-blank-face-lp-review/">Check out my full review here</a>.

<strong>Smoke DZA &amp; Pete Rock — <em>Don't Smoke Rock</em></strong>

I was made privy to the existence of this Smoke DZA and Pete Rock collabo while it was still in it's early phases—and was highly anticipating an incredible record.</p><p>It didn't disappoint; it was a Pete Rock sounding as hungry as he did while making <em>Petestrumentals</em>, and Smoke DZA achieving super-seyan.</p><p>It's full blown NYC hip-hop at it's finest, with an exciting cast of supporting characters. <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/dont-smoke-rock-is-crack-pun-intended/">Check out my full review here</a>.

<strong>A$AP Ferg — <em>Always Strive &amp; Prosper</em></strong>

I was a Ferg fan from the jump.</p><p>Records like "Shabba Ranks," "Work," and "Dump Dump" were iTunes mainstays for me; but his new record, Always Strive &amp; Prosper did more to open him up as an artist in my opinion.</p><p>After three solid listens to the 18 song effort, I felt as though I was more into Ferg as a person; he gave listeners a chance to get to understand him a bit more clearly.</p><p>From an ode to his block and professions of love to dealing with the loss of Yams—the record had a little of everything. <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/aap-ferg-always-strive-prosper/">Check out my full review here</a>.

<strong>Hodgy — <em>Fireplace:TheNotTheOtherSide</em></strong>

Hardcore fans were saddened to watch as their beloved Odd Future crumbled before their eyes—the nail in the coffin being the public fallout of Tyler and Hodgy Beats.</p><p>Hodgy—who dropped the 'beats'—decided to step out on his own, and the results were surprisingly dope.</p><p>I walked the line with the OF catalog, but this album was focused, mature, and a fantastic debut for the (still) young emcee.</p><p>Rumor has it he's working on a collabo with Nelly Furtado next.<a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/a-new-day-hodgy-steps-out-with-his-solo-debut/"> Check out my full review here</a>.

<strong>Kanye — <em>The Life of Pablo</em></strong>

Kanye has had a roller coaster year, no matter how you slice it; however, he still managed to channel his "genius" into the highly anticipated <em>TLOP</em>.</p><p>Conceptually—as a top to bottom listen—it's amazing.</p><p>Love or hate Yeezy, his strength (from a listener's perspective) is his OCD-level of meticulousness when sequencing his albums.</p><p>This has an oddly 'rough' feeling to it, which is hard to explain, but it adds charm.</p><p>Whether or not you were thrown off by his last album, which was quite polarizing , this was Kanye returning to a more palatable level of dopeness.

<strong>ATCQ — We Got It From Here...Thank You 4 Your Service</strong>

I'll be honest and admit that I was also privy to the fact that Tribe was working on an album long before it was announced.</p><p>I was sworn to secrecy—and my 'mole' will remain nameless. 18 years later, and this album was everything we wanted it to be.</p><p>After a tough week for those of us who had to watch (with heavy hearts) as Trump—for lack of a better term—"trumped" the election, this album helped to make the monumental week a little brighter.</p><p>I'd be Denise not to mention that I was in my feelings listening to this album.</p><p>It will stand as a final effort from the original iteration of the group, and a monument to hip-hop culture.</p><p>RIP Phife. <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/atcq-drop-their-long-awaited-final-album-and-its-wonderful/">Check out my full review here</a>.

<strong>SnowGoons — <em>Goon Bap</em></strong>

There aren't many albums like Goon Bap these days.</p><p>If you have an affinity towards 90s hip-hop and you haven't yet taken in this CD yet, you're missing out—in a major way.</p><p>The production is timeless, and the curated guest list does a remarkable job of bringing together legends like the late Pumpkinhead and younger acts, like Pun's son Chris Rivers, to create a cohesive top to bottom boom-bap smorgasbord with few loose ends.</p><p>Also, "The 90s Are Back" features Psycho Les, Dres, Sticky Fingaz, Nine, Ras Kass, and more on one record—epic is an understatement.

<strong>The Avalanches — <em>Wildflower</em></strong>

To understand the work that went into this album is to know the love and care that the group puts into their craft.</p><p>Recorded over the period 16 years, amongst illness,  comings and goings, sample clearance issues, and a lack of rumors, the album is a masterpiece, and one of the finest examples of plunderphonics you’re likely to find.</p><p>If you’re a fan of producers like J.Rocc, you need to get up on this album — immediately. <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/danny-brown-mf-doom-and-more-guest-on-the-avalanches-wildflower/">Read my full review here</a>.

<strong>De La Soul — And The Anonymous Nobody...</strong>

Although they haven’t released an official album since 2004’s The Grind Date, it’s unfair to say De La Soul weren’t active for the past 12 years.</p><p>They were festival mainstays performing for excited fans who had come into their own along with the group through the early 1990s.</p><p>They didn’t feel pressure to make new material and the Anonymous Nobody… is organic in the best way possible.</p><p>It came about from both sheer crowd-sourced demand and the trio’s undying love of the art itself.</p><p>Nothing here is rushed, forced or out of place.</p><p>The album doesn’t try to fit into any box for the purpose of selling records.</p><p>Hell, the records were pre-sold, so stakes weren’t that high.</p><p>But they still put together one of their strongest efforts yet. <a href="http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/08/de-la-soul-make-a-strong-return-with-and-the-anonymous-nobody/">Check my full review for XXL magazine</a>.
