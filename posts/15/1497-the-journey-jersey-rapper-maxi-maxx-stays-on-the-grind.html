  <h1>The Journey: Jersey Rapper Maxi Maxx Stays On The Grind</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>If one were to ask “who is the most played artist in Jersey via SoundCloud,” there’s a good chance Maxi Maxx May not be the first name to pop in your head — even though he ranks second in the state only to Fetty Wap with 50 million plays.</p><p>The Jersey rapper has been in the game for just over seven years, working with some incredible notable acts along the way, like the recently released Meek Mill.</p><p>So why hasn’t the young upstart ascended to the next level?</p><p>He’s on his way.

Currently, he’s connected with Interscope — strictly as a host for distribution of his music — but Maxx is hopeful the relationship could blossom further as he preps his full 2018 LP.</p><p>Today, though, he’s reveling in positive feedback from his latest mixtape, <i>Everybody Raps</i>, which features (aside from his crew) vocals from songstress Kehlani (“Cum Thru”).

“This tape was just to let everybody know who I am,” he tells AAHH. “The official album is  when they get more comfortable ... this tape was just to let them know that I'm still here.”

It’s an understandable motivation; though he’s had some incredible looks, he’s had some disheartening false-starts and setbacks.</p><p>His first significant opportunity came after a chance meeting with Meek Mill, who was impressed by songs off of Maxx’s Lazy K hosted debut.

&amp;nbsp;
Meek was interested in remixing one of Maxx’s records, but due to clearance issues Maxx couldn’t facilitate it; that led to them working on the song “Weak People,” which to date has over 1.6 million plays. “He sent it back 48 hours, no charge,” he says. “ was like ‘this one is on me, the next one is on you.’ Ever since then, we kept in contact.</p><p>We were in touch through the whole Nicki Minaj relationship; he kept calling me, putting me on game ... kept motivating me like that.</p><p>Like a big brother.”

The deal was on the table, however — much to his chagrin — it was a writing deal for lesser-known MMG artists.</p><p>As well, during that period, Maxx saw a situation his cousin Choo Biggz went through during a video shoot for the song “Tonight” featuring Tank, Fetty Wap, and 50 Cent.</p><p>Though he was paid, Fif was a no-show.</p><p>The experience left a bad taste in his mouth and jaded him on the prospect of signing to other artists.

“That's what made me not want to sign to other artists because other artists don't want to see you grow,” he states.</p><p>He’s grown from the situation, and is more motivated than ever; with a catalog that includes the likes of Jeremih, Weeknd, and Yachty, he is ready to be more than just an artist you’ve heard here or there.</p><p>Instead, he’s aiming for the spotlight — and a chance to share his whole truth on a larger scale.

“I will be the best rapper then come out of Jersey,” he says with a laugh. “Shout out to Redman.”</p></div>
