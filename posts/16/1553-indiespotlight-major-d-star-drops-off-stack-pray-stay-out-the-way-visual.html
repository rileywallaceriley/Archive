  <h1>#IndieSpotlight: Major D-Star Drops Off "Stack Pray & Stay Out The Way" Visual</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Gotta love when an artist you like drop a project you're feeling, and proceeds to give a visual identity to the records you were feeling the most.</p><p>That's the case for AAHH mainstay Major D-Star; after releasing his long-awaited <i>Trap</i> <i>Star</i>  mixtape back in February, he is dropping off "Stack Pray &amp; Stay Out The Way," a song I personally described as an illustration of his immense focus on his "current hustle of choice, music."
<h4><a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/major-d-star-drops-trap-star-mixtape/"><strong>RECENT: Major D-Star Drops “Trap Star” Mixtape</strong></a></h4>
The video, like his others, delivers on quality.</p><p>Directed by Wally Woo, with a multitude of scenery interspersed around a loose storyline of himself working as a mechanic -- which he playfully describes as his way of "stacking and staying out the way" in the into -- it gives ample life to one of his project's most infectious earworms.</p><p>If you have yet to bump his full mixtape, go ahead and click here; either way, press play on this catchy little banger, below.</p></div>
