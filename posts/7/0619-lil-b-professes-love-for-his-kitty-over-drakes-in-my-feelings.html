  <div class="meta">2018-07-23 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Lil B's based freestyles are back.In his latest blessing, the BasedGod flips Drake's chart-topping single "In My Feelings" into a strangely endearing tribute to his adopted tabby cat Keke."Keke, that's my kitty, he's adopted," he raps before dedicating most of his bars to loosely describing the role of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA). "Got a lot of cats ... they be saving them, feeding them, having them, playing with them."https://soundcloud.com/lilblovesthebasedgod/lil-b-keke-thats-my-kitty-based-freestyle-adopted-cats-specialThe San Francisco location of the SPCA recently tried to catch the #InMyFeelingsChallenge wave on Twitter in an attempt to help a short-haired Chihuahua named Kiki find a home.</p><p>The Bay Area's BasedGod lent his support to the SPCA in this freestyle without any prompting though.This is the second time Lil B has dedicated a record to Keke.</p><p>After initially adopting the cat back in 2012, he promptly released a record featuring his pet's purrs -- proclaiming him to be the first animal in Hip Hop.</p></div>
