  <h1>Bishop Nehru Drags DOOM Out Of The Dungeon</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>If you've been following Nas new as of late, you may have noticed he signed a young brother named Bishop Nehru to his <em>Mass Appeal</em> imprint.</p><p>Bishop, who's name is a direct nod to Tupac's <em>Juice</em> role and former prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, who worked closely with Gandhi, is indeed a good look for the label.</p><p>If his recent release is any indication of what's to come, we're in for a revival of that 90's nostalgia.

His latest release <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/nehruviandoom/id902590439">NehruvianDOOM</a> is a collaboration with the often illusion – always dope – <a href="http://www.metalfacedoom.com/">MF DOOM</a>.</p><p>The 9 tracks gem, which is available on vinyl if you're vinyl head, is a pleasure to listen to.</p><p>Insightful lyrics, slamming beats and an overall vibe that takes us back.</p><p>Tracks like <em>Mean The Most</em> and <em>Caskets</em> will have you (figuratively) wearing out your rewind button.</p><p>MF DOOM's production, we should note, is also top-notch – less of a departure than JJ DOOM may have been for some heads – plus new DOOM bars are ALWAYS coveted.</p><p>It's easy to see what Nas was thinking with this one.</p><p>Keep your eyes (and ears) on Bishop – we know we will.
