  <h1>Nicki Minaj’s New Tracks Bring Out Passionate Fans & Detractors</h1>
  <div class="meta">2018-04-12 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>As promised, Nicki Minaj delivered two brand new singles on Thursday (April 12), "Barbie Tingz" and "Chun-Li." Released in tandem with a Zane Lowe interview on Beats 1, the songs seem to focus on past and current industry friction -- which is clearly drawing a clear line in the sand for listeners."I pull up in that quarter milli off the lot ... oh, now she tryna be friends like I forgot," she raps on "Chun-Li," which some people believe is a dig at Cardi B.More than anything, the two singles -- her first solo drops since last year's #3PackFromParis -- work to reassert her dominance in Hip Hop.</p><p>As one might expect, her dedicated fan base were all the way here for it.Still, many appear to find her need to (seemingly) stir the pot frustrating and a little boring, especially given how well Cardi's debut album Invasion Of Privacy has been received.</p><p>She even brings up Remy on "Barbie Tingz," with jabs at her inability to craft any massive mainstream hits."It's time to make hits and it's time to diss ... how you still dissin', still can't find some hits," she raps.It's clear she doesn't appear to be winning any new fans with these releases.</p></div>
