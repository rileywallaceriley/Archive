  <div class="content"><p>In today's sea of endless mainstream mumbly commercially viable nonsense we often unable to deeply connect with an artist's music.</p><p>Now, that's either because it's just a series of incoherent dribble, or because it fails to scratch the surface.</p><p>This inability to put themselves into the music and truly connect with listeners is the difference between rapping because it's a 'cool thing to do,' and rapping as an artistic outlet or means of escape.</p><p>JFields is the latter.</p><p>At a young age, JFields went through the foster system and truly had to endure some terrible stuff.</p><p>Once experience he openly shares is that he was put in a pot of scalding hot water by a foster parent in a cruel act at the age 3 -- which is horrendous.</p><p>He spent the better part of his childhood jumping around, leaving him feeling quite detached from basic elements on Maslow's hierarchy of needs.</p><p>He manages to find some of the love and belonging he lacked in gang OGs, and became involved in a street life of sex, drugs, and violence.</p><p>Now, music had always been a part of his life -- indeed, he was brought up singing ]in church choir and was really into the southern hip-hop vibes that gripped the game in the nineties era.</p><p>He started making beats as a hobby; it soon blossomed into a passion that nosedived into a career.</p><p>His difficult past has become a source of inspiration for his music, and a series of hard life lessons that are serving to help him be both a positive, hardworking person and father to his baby girl.</p><p>His story is inspiring, and his music is dope -- JFields is an artist worth checking out.</p><p>This isn't suburban wanna-be fantasy rap; this is an artist whose been through it all, putting it all on the line.</p><p>A true underdog story.</p><p>The stuff that the hip-hop culture used to readily embrace with open arms.</p><p>Check it out.</p><p>Positivty reigns supreme.</p><p>For more info and video content, <a href="http://www.SuperSavy405.com">peep his site</a>.
