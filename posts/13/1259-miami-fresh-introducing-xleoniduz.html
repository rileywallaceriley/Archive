  <h1>Miami Fresh: Introducing Xleoniduz</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Miami, Florida, rapper Xleoniduz  was molded on the mid 90's hip-hop which was dominated -- predominantly -- by Def Jam Records. "The 'X' comes from Malcolm x and DMX, and the 'Z' at the end is from Jay-Z -- my other favorite rapper," he confidently explains.</p><p>As a youth, his father was both a DJ and an underground rapper; it's been noted he was an underground pioneer at rapping bilingual.</p><p>His love of rap was ultimately instilled through his father, who would blast Rakim, Biggie, 2pac, Ice Cube, Craig Mack, and Redman.</p><p>His parents split at a young age, and he affectionately recalls when he went to visit his mother one summer (either 1996 or 1997); "My mom had this album called Supa Dupa Fly by Missy Elliott, and I was like WTF is this?</p><p>I fell in love with the beats and the sounds especially "Beep Me 911." Her roommate one day notices that all I did was listen to music, so she one day introduced me DMX, Jay-Z, and Busta Rhymes.</p><p>From that moment on I wanted to do was music." That sentiment has rung true, as he's been grinding like a madman on the local scene recently -- and starting to build a buzz with his first three singles.</p><p>One of which, "Dominican Bitch," is produced by Icy Twat of the illustrious Divine Council (who recently signed with LA Reid).</p><p>Check out his Q&amp;A with us below, and get familiar with him and his music.

<b>Where are you from originally?</b>

I'm from Miami; specifically, Dade County -- raised in Allapattah and Wynwood/Overtown.

<b>How would you describe your sound?</b>

My sound is a mixture of different things; I'm influenced by Jay-Z, Pusha T, Pharrell,  DMX, Kid Cudi, and André 3000.

<b>How did you get involved in music?</b>

I got involved in music through my father; he was a DJ in a local club in Allapattah, Miami, which is mainly Dominicans.</p><p>He would rap.</p><p>My father introduced me to music at like four years old, and I've been in love with it ever since.</p><p>I  also I remember watching the video for "Nigga What, Nigga Who?"  by Jay-Z and "Supa Dupa Fly" by Missy as a kid and knowing that I wanted to rap.

<b>What have you dropped so far?</b>

I have released three songs on SoundCloud -- so far -- and a video on YouTube.</p><p>I'm working on new songs as we speak; I have a project coming out called Sin Paradise, which is a nickname I gave to Miami.</p><p>It's how I see Miami through my eyes and lots of story telling about my life and things that go on in in the city.</p><p>My song "Windows" will be on iTunes, Spotify, and Tidal very soon.

<b>What are your goals in the industry?</b>

My goals are simple; I'm inspired by Rocafella Records, so I want to own myself as much as possible, but ink a deal with a major label as a distributor, and work my way to the top.</p><p>I have friends who are on the same wavelength as me.</p><p>We all do something different, and we just wanna bring something new -- and not repetitive -- to music

<b>So, what's next?</b>

The next thing I see for myself is working dropping more songs; building and getting better at my craft and getting out from the bottom.</p><p>I come from nothing, so I'm doing whatever I can to make it out.
