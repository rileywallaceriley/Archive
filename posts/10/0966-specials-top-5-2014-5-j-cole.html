  <h1>Special’s Top 5 of 2014: #3 J.Cole</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>J.Cole is kind of a polarizing artist – and for what reason I don’t know.</p><p>You love him or you don’t listen to him (I refuse to categorize that as hate).</p><p>I admit, I slept on him for a while before delving in (<em>pause</em>).</p><p>For those who are a fan of the young king – his latest 2014 Forest Hill Drive is a personal, poignent example of good hip-hop.</p><p>Over 13 tracks, Cole eloquently rocks his heart on his sleeve and struts over subject matter that ranges from first (and various) sexual experiences to issues of race and self-worth.

The album is largely produced by Cole himself, with some exceptions – <em>'03 Adolesence</em>, <em>Tale of 2 Cities</em> and <em>Love Truly</em> were produced by Willie B., Vinylz and !llmind/Cardiak respectively.</p><p>The other exceptions have Cole "co-producing", so he is extremely hands on (and it shows).</p><p>From blasting white rappers on the banging <em>Fire Squad</em>, chasing dreams on the Mobb Deep sampled <em>St.</p><p>Tropez</em> or flexing hindsight and regret on <em>Apparently</em>, Cole shows a lot of himself on this record – and his honesty is paying off.

The album has thus far been extremely well received by fans around the world, and with good reason.</p><p>Cole is just a good dude.</p><p>Whether he’s buying his mother’s foreclosed home (his childhood home), or visiting fans to personally play them his new record, Cole just seems like a good person – and it isn’t unnoticed by his core audience, who are propelling this latest project up the charts.</p><p>It's available everywhere now – A MUST LISTEN!
