Growing up in Laurens, South Carolina -- a town with a relatively small population, yet a higher than average crime rate -- rapper MillyBoy found himself on the run from the law.</p><p>Milly, whose name draws influence from the area he came up in , grew up in a single-parent home with his two sisters.</p><p>Being a product of the environment, it was inevitable that he fell victim to the streets.</p><p>In a twist of fate -- while on the run -- Milly decided to audition for BET's One Shot, a new show with a format not unlike America's Got Talent; except, this show focuses on hip-hop artists flexing their original content.</p><p>Milly made a  impression on the panel of judges that included Sway, King Tech, and more.</p><p>The attention and high praise from the panel of industry tastemakers was a wake-up call; Milly knew he had to put the past behind him, and turned himself in  and did his time.</p><p>Now -- with his legal woes behind him -- he's determined to take his career to the next level.</p><p>Sonically, his versatile style has drawn comparisons to Boosie, Young Thug, and other southern heavy hitters.</p><p>His debut single, "Neva Stop," which debuted on the illustrious World Star Hip Hop has already garnered him a ton of industry buzz.</p><p>He's currently hard at work on his debut EP, tentatively titled The <i>Prodigal Prodigy</i>. "The upcoming EP is gonna show how broad my range of music is," remarks Milly. "I also sing and write -- so it won't all be trap music; although, that is a big part of what I do."
