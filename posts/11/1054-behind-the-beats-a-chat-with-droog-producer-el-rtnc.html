Nothing beats a little mystery, especially when it comes to launching a new music artist.</p><p>Hip-hop has had it's share of "slow reveals" over the years.</p><p>Remember the "Who Is Cam'Ron" campaign in the Source magazine pre-<i><a href="http://youtu.be/DdiHt1iUIrk">Confessions of Fire</a></i>?</p><p>Or how about the "who is Joe Budden" debate back when his <a href="http://youtu.be/0kT_So0BITQ">DJ Clue freestyles</a> where starting to raise eyebrows.</p><p>Keeping people guessing until the grand curtain draw can help build sufficient buzz to presell albums and shows, as well as score deals.</p><p>Keep in mind though, it's (much) harder to maintain that same level of artistic anonymity in the Internet age...</p><p>Or is it?</p><p>The most recent mystery/conspiracy in hip-hop was the identity of the Coney Island rhyme spitter, Your Old Droog.</p><p>His vocal tone had damn near everyone, even industry insiders, <i>convinced</i> it was Nas Esco himself releasing music under a new monicker.</p><p>When the smoke cleared, that was proven to be untrue; however, that takes nothing away from Droog.</p><p>His flow was so tight, it was held against Illmatic era Nas – pretty impressive shit.

Like most heads, I was immediately taken in by Droog for two reasons: his complex rhyme schemes and his captivating production, courtesy of El RTNC.</p><p>Much like Droog himself, RTNC has a bit of mystery behind him.</p><p>He gives little away about himself online, and has gone by many monickers over the years: Rich Boogie, R.Thentic, El RTNC &amp; now El 108 RTNC.</p><p>With the release of his latest beat tape <i><a href="https://rtnc.bandcamp.com/album/sam">Sam</a></i>, which contains many Droog original, I thought I should reach out and learn more about the man behind the beats.</p><p>Interview below.

<hr />

<b>How did you get into producing?</b>

The first record that I ever did was L Fudge’s <i><a href=" Me Your Gratitude</a> </i>(Rawkus).</p><p>That's the first record I feel comfortable saying I produced.</p><p>I knew how it "should" sound and even ended up giving back the check I was paid for it to go back into the studio to get it “right”… Now at this time, I was still pretty new to making records.</p><p>In fact, it was my first year right out of high school.</p><p>I’d have to really fast forward all the way up to my first works with Homeboy Sandman (<i><a href="http://youtu.be/utcUKBw7aV0">Kool Herc: Fertile Crescent</a></i> on Stones Throw) until I actually produced another record that I was confident in.</p><p>Everything in-between was me learning how to make beats in my own way, instead of trying to sound like Premier or Jay Dee.</p><p>More importantly, I was taking notes and figuring out how to actually produce a record.

<b>What was the first beat you ever sold?</p><p>What was the feeling like?</b>

That would be L Fudge’s <i><a href=" Me Your Gratitude</a>, </i>and then with him again on <i><a href="http://youtu.be/s6fpD_kEBvo">A Conversation With Hop</a></i>.</p><p>I honour Fudge to this day, because without him opening the door to me when he received his (Rawkus) deal, I don’t think I’d have made it in.</p><p>I was too new to it all.</p><p>I had no mentor to teach me the machines, or even how to buy records.</p><p>I didn’t come from a very musical household, so I was really all on my own with my learning process.</p><p>Plus, when I did meet people, I didn’t really reach out because I’ve always been shy and didn’t want anyone to even get a hint that I might be wack.</p><p>Stupidity in hindsight.</p><p>I was happy to get a check for what I was doing, but in the early days I was more concerned with getting good.</p><p>My friend 88 keys talked about being around the greats like Q Tip &amp; Large Professor early in his career – and I can’t lie, I feel so envious at times; however, the “thing” I do now is all a product of my experiences getting here.

<b>How did you originally meet Droog?</b>

A mutual friend of ours called me one day and asked me to listen to a rough he had done to see if I could send him some beats.</p><p>I did, and droog didn’t really go for them.</p><p>Instead of accepting rejection, I sent more. 2 full “beat tapes” actually (part of one is on the <a href="http://myrtnc.bandcamp.com">myrtnc.bandcamp.com</a> store under the name <i><a href="https://rtnc.bandcamp.com/album/sam">Sam</a></i>).</p><p>From there he made the EP.</p><p>I was at a point where I really didn’t want to do one or two records for people anymore, and I still kind of don’t (with some exception).</p><p>Rather, I wanted to work on a whole body of work, or better yet, be in a band scenario.</p><p>The latter came to fruition when <a href="http://youtu.be/s55aBLx0wYQ">DJ Skizz</a> and I added our elements to <i><a href="http://youtu.be/6y8rvZ-LKR0">U 47</a> </i>(I was responsible for the drums) &amp; <i><a href="http://youtu.be/ZrS7VC_Uqrs">You Know What Time It Is</a></i> (I chopped up the loop there).

<b>When everyone thought he was Nas at first, how hard was it for you to keep his identity secret?</b>

The Nas thing still gets me, because to this day, I don’t hear Nas in Droog’s voice.</p><p>It's one thing to have a similar vocal tone, heck, that’s biology.</p><p>But, for people to think it was Nas meant that an elevated standard was being met.</p><p>Droog is a great artist.</p><p>He’s creating lines and concepts while just bugging out.</p><p>You can tell he’s someone that genuinely loves to create.</p><p>As far as identity, I for one never did <i>anything</i> to keep his identity a secret.</p><p>Droog's identity was concealed simply because he didn’t care for being on social media.</p><p>While many flocked to it, he wasn’t interested.</p><p>He just wanted to make good songs.

<b>You have such an original, underground sound.</p><p>What/who are some of your inspirations?</b>

Personally, I don’t think I have an underground sound at all.</p><p>I think it’s more of a classic rock and jazz sound if anything.</p><p>On top of that, I don’t think underground even exists anymore.</p><p>The internet has leveled the playing field.</p><p>Some months ago, when we released the <i><a href="http://youtu.be/bMrzJ-lKQiU">Kinison</a></i> project, I noticed we were on the DJ Semtex top 5  with Drake &amp; Migos.</p><p>It’s a beautiful time, where young people are just free to create without some of the “rules” I grew up with.</p><p>The only rule there ought to be is for the music to be awesome.</p><p>That said, I’ll always credit Gang Starr’s <i><a href="http://youtu.be/JsFwPDRJeAw">Who's Gonna Take The Weight</a></i> with being the record that made my ears perk up and say "what ever that is, THAT’S what I wanna do with my life".</p><p>Much later on, Slum Village’s “<a href="http://youtu.be/XAy-mPLU-sg">Beej N Dem</a>” became my own “Dilla Changed My Life” moment.</p><p>I could go on and on talking about him, but as I’m a sensitive one, I’ll just say that without his work (that touched me so much in his early career), I may have stopped making beats.</p><p>Tribe &amp; De La are king, but so is Led Zeppelin, Vince Guaraldi, Stereolab, &amp; The Red Hot Chili Peppers to name a few.</p><p>Q Tip, Pete Rock &amp; Large Professor are high on theproducer list too.

<b>What are you currently working on?</p><p>Any dope tracks we should be on the lookout for?</b>

As of late, I’ve started putting out my own beat projects on my bandcamp page (<a href="http://rtnc.bandcamp.com">rtnc.bandcamp.com</a>), because I realized that I was sitting on so many pieces of music.</p><p>It made no sense to keep them hoarded.</p><p>When I made them, I knew I wanted to share them – and I'm really happy to be able to do so now.</p><p>I’ve also gotten the chance to be around some really great artists since the Droog project came out, and some records are definitely in the works but out of a "jinx fear", I’ll just say to stay tuned.</p><p>Oh, but you can look out for <i>The Nicest </i>EP by Your Old Droog coming up in a couple weeks.

<b>Any last words for our readers?</b>
