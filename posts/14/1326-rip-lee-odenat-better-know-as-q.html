  <h1>RIP Lee O’Denat, better know as 'Q'</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>CNN of the ghetto, a cesspool of coonery, the most influential hip-hop website.</p><p>World Star Hip Hop has been called many things by many people.</p><p>Ultimately, the brainchild of the late Lee O’Denat was a mirror pointed directly at a subsection of the web that helped to bolster the site's staggering level of daily traffic.</p><p>It effectively says more about its users than it does about Q. Shit, all he does is aggregate the content—he doesn't film the fights, ratchet music videos and public shaming.</p><p>He also didn't grant them the millions of views they received.</p><p>Supply and demand.</p><p>As far as web-entrepreneurs go, Q is an inspirational figure; what began as a mixtape site—which was eventually hacked—grew into a simple aggregator that became a culture shifting source of what's what and who's who.</p><p>Q and his wife (the site's co-founder) created an inescapable pillar, which serves as almost a hip-hop centric Reddit, for lack of a better explanation.</p><p>As a fellow urban website owner, it's impossible not to acknowledge Q as the g.o.a.t of this!</p><p>Tragically, Q passed away this week as the result of heart disease that was  heavily influenced by obesity; as the RIP messages pop up, I have seen some rather disturbing rhetoric about how deplorable WSHH is, as though that in some way reflects directly upon the site's creator.</p><p>Aside from label submitted and exclusive premieres—both paid—the site was made up of user-generated content.</p><p>Just putting that out there.</p><p>WSHH is an incredible accomplishment, even as just an ideological concept—and it's one that Q was proud of.</p><p>Prayers are with his family and close friends in this one as they deal with the loss.</p><p>The site's future is up in the air; but, it will never be quite the same.</p><p>RIP, Q.</p></div>
