  <h1>Vin-O Take Listeners On A Ride Through DC</h1>

  <div class="content"><p>I get a lot of artists that submit content here at AAHH; I'll shamelessly admit to a few things I often use to initially judge rappers: their artwork and their co-signs.</p><p>These can help me to sort through artists who are next up, and artists who have some machine—or angel-connection—behind them.</p><p>Vin-O is one such artist, sort of.</p><p>I'll admit his artwork kind of through me off initially, as did the title of his project; BUT, a cruise through his Facebook revealed that he had been working with Chuckie Thompson.</p><p>For those in the dark, he's one of the producers in Puffy's infamous in-house team.</p><p>His credits are intense, but "Big Poppa," Craig Mack's iconic "Flava In Ya Ear," and Biggie's posthumous hit "Dead Wrong" are among them.</p><p>Naturally, I shrugged and pushed play.

<i>Death Of A Poet, Birth Of A Gamesta</i> is a thirteen-song project that has some of the same characteristics that a  bride looks for on her wedding day: something new and something borrowed.</p><p>The album boasts a wealth of truly impressive production value, although much of it feels familiar in a sea of similar production.</p><p>Not necessarily a bad thing—the project is current and can easily slot into most 2016 playlists with ease.</p><p>Lyrically Vin-o seems like an old head; off the rip, he asserts the street shit that gleams through the cracks in the fancy new gentrified city of Washington DC.</p><p>Through the album's cuts like "Wintaz In DC" and "Bizness As Usual," we hear tales from a DC-native that has seen some of the more insidious sights the nation's capital has to offer residents in it's rougher areas.</p><p>I felt his personality come alive—more so—on records like "Untold Tales." That record specifically was packed with an equal balance of wordplay and autobiographical context; "An 80s baby still a baby in the crazy 80s, dead bodies had my neighborhood pushing daisies." It's when he focuses on first-hand tales of perseverance and social injustice, like on the record "G.O.D." that you get him.</p><p>Those aforementioned records had a different tempo/feel, as well.</p><p>That actually resulted in a slightly different style that really suits him.</p><p>His music is quality—plain and simple.</p><p>His vocals are crispy, and his cadence is unique.</p><p>He's worth a few listens—check out the album below and then explore his catalog.
