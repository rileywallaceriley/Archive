  <h1>Myles Anthony Teams Up With Pusha T For A New Single</h1>

-- Pusha T</blockquote>
Vancouver, British Columbia, resident  and producer Myles Anthony, and his frequent collaborator, the well-travelled/toured, African-born, philanthropic musician -- and now BC resident -- Ezra Kwizera, are back with another super dope single.</p><p>Building on their last piece, "Shinin'" is an atmospheric, moody song that you may imagine as a backdrop to a slow-motion training montage for the Rio Olympics, or a Nike commercial.</p><p>This time, though, they have a guest -- the G.O.O.D Music head honcho King Push, more commonly known as Pusha T. Push has been making a lot of noise thus far in 2016, with <em>Darkest Before Dawn: The Prelude</em>  picking up steam.</p><p>He shines  with his trademark dealer-bars: "BET, wanna see how I'm living?</p><p>Well, come on in we ain't gotta leave the kitchen." The feature is a  good look for the BC producer, and an exciting insight into what he has coming up.</p><p>He's been busy in the studio preparing a full-length that will feature a multitude of artists over his beats.</p><p>If "Shinin'" is any indication of what he has in the stash, the project could prove to be quite successful for the Canadian-native.</p><p>Stay tuned!
