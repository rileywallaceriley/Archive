  <h1>Koncept Talks Korea & Premieres New Video For "Never Again"</h1>

  <div class="content"><p>It's all about trusting the journey because sometimes following your gut can take you into unexpected territory.</p><p>Just ask Queens (New York) rapper Koncept -- one-time Fat Beats employee and former member of the Brown Bag All Stars.</p><p>He'd built a bankable brand as a solo act, blazing from the onset of his debut LP back at the top of 2012.</p><p>Having worked his J57 collaborative project <em>The Fuel</em> and having just about wrapped his next LP (which would become <em>14 Hours Ahead</em>), he set off on a short tour in Seoul, the capital of South Korea.</p><p>That was almost two years ago, and Kon has finally made his return to New York City after what became an unexpected odyssey of overseas fame.

"I was only supposed to be there for two weeks ... the tour got extended," he reveals to AAHH. "I ended up partnering with Sony Music , and it was a domino effect into a bunch of things." The label made him an offer he couldn't refuse, but as they agreed to release his <em>14 Hours Ahead</em> LP, the deal required him to stick around indefinitely. "They said they wanted me to stay over there for the rollout of the album, so I could be face to face in the country, play shows, promote my brand and the album."

The LP's success led to a consistent touring schedule. "I tried to come back a few times," he notes.</p><p>Each time he attempted to return, bookings would pile one, forcing him to abandon the plans. "This time I was straight up, like, 'all right, I'm going to go back to New York.</p><p>I'm going to fly out June 20th.</p><p>Like there are no bookings after June 15th, you know what I mean?'"

"I just been nonstop," he continues. "I just finished this new album, and I want to drop these news videos I have ... but I just  regroup and take a little rest, you know what I mean?</p><p>Chill for a little bit and then get back into everything." The first of these new videos -- there are five in total -- "Never Again" is premiering right here on AAHH. "It's just about not making the same mistakes and learning from your experiences," he says of the track, "just getting rid of all of the negative things in your life, from relationships to friendships, etc."


&amp;nbsp;
Ultimately, he credits his time in Korea with helping him break ground that merely networking online wouldn't have allowed -- which is a big takeaway for any artist considering touring overseas. "I'm constantly booked ...</p><p>I play three shows a week.</p><p>There's a real connection with the people, the fans, and with the industry as a whole out there." Though he'd already tasted some initial success stateside, the same success that led him to Korea in the first place, what's he's built over there has been next level. "Going out there and just being the unicorn, just being different, instantly people gravitated towards it." On top of just a hectic live schedule, he also landed numerous print magazine placements and even commercial placements -- notably appearing in Spyder clothing ads that appeared across Asia in movie theatres.

Perhaps most importantly, it's sparked a whole new wave of creativity for Koncept. "It's dope because it's in a different place is just really inspiring.</p><p>You know what I mean?</p><p>Walking outside every day and just seeing things that I'm not used to, meeting different people ... it's a whole other inspiration." As he explains, the outlook has given his music an even more unique vibe than it already had. "I'm not to trying to be pigeonholed as a New York rapper ... there's a big world out here.</p><p>I'm trying to be a fucking a global artist, you know, global musician."
