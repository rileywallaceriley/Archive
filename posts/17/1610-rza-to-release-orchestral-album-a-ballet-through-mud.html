<p>Wu-Tang Clan founder RZA is set to release "A Ballet Through Mud," an orchestral album inspired by his teenage writings, on August 30 through the Platoon label.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The album, a recorded version of a ballet <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/rza-orchestral-album-a-ballet-through-mud-1235064029/">RZA</a> composed and produced, was performed by the Colorado Symphony Orchestra in 2023.</p><p>It marks a departure from his hip-hop roots, exploring themes of love, exploration, and adventure.</p>

<p>RZA, born Robert Diggs, discovered the project's inspiration during the pandemic when he revisited lyrical songbooks from his youth in Staten Island, which he affectionately calls "Shaolin."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I have been composing my whole life, although I didn't know initially that was what I was doing," RZA said in a statement. "The inspiration for 'A Ballet Through Mud' comes from my earliest creative output as a teenager, but its themes are universal."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The album follows RZA's 2023 orchestral concerts featuring Wu-Tang Clan's seminal "36 Chambers" album.</p><p>It also builds on his extensive experience scoring films, which includes soundtracks for "Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai" (1999), "Kill Bill: Vol. 1" (2003), and "The Man with the Iron Fists" (2012), which he also directed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>RZA hopes listeners will use the album "to score their own lives, to transform a drive to the grocery store or sharing a meal with loved ones into something magical.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This orchestral venture represents RZA's continued evolution as an artist, blending his hip-hop background with classical elements and showcasing his growth as a composer beyond the realm of rap music.</p>
