    <div class="content"><p>It's impossible not to recognize the immense influence JAY-Z has had on Hip Hop, both musically and from a business perspective. It's also hard not to argue the impact he's had on other rappers and producers who truly live for lyricism.</p>
<p>Like many other fans, artists were up at midnight eager to hear what one of the culture's most enduring and well-respected brands had to bring to the table.Understandably, most of them pressed play on 4:44 and liked it as much as everyone else. Many took to Twitter to share their excitement.While it's still too early to throw any proper accreditations and titles around, 4:44 is — almost across the board — being held up as a much-needed return to The Blueprint Hov who forced rappers to work a little harder back in the peak of the Rocafella era.</p>
