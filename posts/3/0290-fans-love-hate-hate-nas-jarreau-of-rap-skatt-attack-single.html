  <h1>Fans Love & Hate HATE Nas’ “Jarreau of Rap (Skatt Attack)” Single</h1>
  <div class="meta">2019-07-15 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>With Nas’ eagerly awaited The Lost Tapes 2 hitting streaming platforms this month, many fans were understandably elated to find the new track “Jarreau of Rap (Skatt Attack)” — the first single — was released on Friday (July 12).</p><p>However, it wasn’t what everyone may have expected.</p><p>With production credits that includes names like Kanye West, Pharrell, Swizz Beatz, Hit-Boy, Pete Rock, No I.D., Alchemist, and Statik Selektah, it’s fair to have anticipated music in the vein of his first Lost Tapes.https://youtu.be/8BEwNkGYkMMWhat Nas delivered, though, was a genre-bending (and obviously polarizing) Al Jarreau sampled track — that also features Keyon Harrold, a renowned trumpeter whose Hip Hop track record includes work with JAY-Z (“Roc Boys”), Mac Miller (“Stay”), and 50 Cent (“Touch the Sky”).Fans, obviously, had their own takes on the track.For others, the song made perfect sense.</p><p>His father is renowned Jazz musician Olu Dara (who first collaborated with his son on the song “Life's a Bitch” off of the holy grail of Hip Hop Illmatic).</p><p>An experimental jazz record, paying a tribute of sorts to the late Jarreau, shouldn’t be as shocking as it is intriguing — especially considering his upbringing.The project is set to feature outtakes from the sessions that led to some of his more debated later releases.</p><p>Was “Jarreau of Rap” the warning shot you hoped it would be?</p><p>Sound off in the comments.The Lost Tapes 2 drops Friday (July 19) via Mass Appeal.</p></div>
