The digitization of the industry has changed the way we interact with the elements that go into making the music we all love – notably the artistic credits.</p><p>Often we can go through a large number of (digital) tracks, many improperly tagged, without becoming overtly aware of the hands behind the boards making your head nod.</p><p>As well, streaming services like Spotify and Deezer fail to detail the production credits correctly.</p><p>Maybe that's what helps young producers like the Harlem-based VDon stay so humble.</p><p>Although he's not (yet) a household name, he has a resume that most producers will live – and die – without topping.</p><p>So far, he's worked with names like <a href=" Bamz</a>, <a href=" The Truth</a>, <a href=" P</a>, <a href=" Rob</a>, <a href=" Rocky</a>, <a href=" Dza</a> and many more.</p><p>I recently had a wonderful chat with VDon, discussing his background, his 2016 aspirations, and his latest EP, <a href="https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit5_efuZPKAhULpB4KHQXSA6sQFggqMAM&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fthe-opiate%2Fid1046266485&amp;usg=AFQjCNEXmHi9Ui_swjsJzRpZ3tS7hMGkig&amp;sig2=VY8cXPniDmCf_qoZa1B83g"><i>The Opiate</i></a> – featuring <a href=" East</a>, <a href=" Lo</a>, and others.</p><p>Check out the interview below, and grab <i>The Opiate</i> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/the-opiate/id1046266485?app=itunes&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4">here</a>.

<strong>How did you get into producing?</strong>

I got into it because my pops was a local DJ.</p><p>He always had equipment around me, like keyboards, drums – that’s how pretty much I started.</p><p>He used to try to teach me how to make beats when I was around 12-13, but I just wasn’t interested at the time.</p><p>I didn’t get into it until I moved out of New York.</p><p>I moved down south for about three years.</p><p>I was bored out there because I'm from the city, so going down south was a different pace.</p><p>I started making beats; I was sending my beats to my friends back in New York, and they were telling me, "you got talent, you need to keep it going."

<strong>Who was the first artist you produced for?</strong>

The first artist?</p><p>Well, there were two that happened around the same time.</p><p>I did a track with Jae Mills (YMCMB), and I did a track with Ransom.

<strong>How did you connect with them?</p><p>When you first started doing it, was it just you going around handing out beat tapes, that sort of thing?</strong>

I was doing that, and back then when I first started, I had a partner.</p><p>We were like a professional duo.</p><p>We would make beat tapes and hand them out; we would also get into studios.</p><p>We knew people from the streets too, so that led us to meet lots of artists.</p><p>Harlem is a small place...

<strong><img class="alignleft" src="http://cdn3.hiphopsince1987.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/v-don1.jpg" alt="" width="294" height="294">It’s interesting because I'm in Toronto, but I’ve been to New York a lot.</p><p>People don’t realize that it’s a big city, but it’s a small place at the same time.</strong>

Yeah, New York is just the scene man.</p><p>That’s another reason I moved back too; I knew I had to work towards getting the artists I wanted to work with, so, I moved back.</p><p>You know just being out in the city you're going to bump into rappers, you're going to bump into people.</p><p>That’s pretty much it.</p><p>In the music scene, everyone knows somebody through one person or another.

<strong>What’s your process?</p><p>Do you sell a beat and walk away?</p><p>Are you hands on?</strong>

Now that I got my studio in the Bronx, I like to be hands on.</p><p>I mean, if the artist is in another state – and it’s my homie – I hit them up and send music over email.</p><p>Lately, though, I’ve liked having artists see me in person, you know, especially if we’re in the same city.

<strong>That's a whole different experience.</strong>

It’s a different vibe when you're there with the artist, sharing ideas with each other.</p><p>As far as making the beats, I like to be by myself creating/preparing them –and then when the artist comes through I just playing a bunch of stuff I have.</p><p>I can make beats on the spot too.

<strong>Can you talk a little bit about <i>The Opiate</i>?</strong>

<i>The Opiate</i> is pretty much a compilation of all the artists I’ve been working with for the last 2 to 3 years.</p><p>I just decided instead of me being on everybody else’s projects, giving them beats, let me put together my EP.</p><p>It just happened that we had extra songs that artists didn’t use for their projects, so I ended up keeping them, and as well, I had collaborators come into the studio to sit down and work with me.</p><p>I just molded how I wanted it to sound.</p><p>It's a showcase of my beats really.

<strong>Which is dope, I like that.</p><p>I like the emphasis on the producer.</strong>

Yeah, I appreciate it.</p><p>Thank you.

<strong>So what else are you working on?</p><p>What else do you have in the works?</strong>

I got a few tracks with Dave East that are unreleased, I'm trying to do a project with him, and I'm attempting to work on a project with my boy Dark Lo from Philly – we’ve been talking about doing something.</p><p>And top of 2016, I'm aiming to get some high profile placements.</p><p>You know, I'm trying to continue doing EPs.</p><p>I don’t want just to do one track on somebody’s mixtape anymore.</p><p>I'd like to handle most of their production; you know what I mean?</p><p>I’m looking forward to working with new artists too.

<strong>Would you more prefer to focus on one artist?</p><p>That changes the vibe of an artist...</strong>

That’s really what I want to do for the majority of 2016.</p><p>I think that’s how a producer gets an identity and how they can separate you from other producers.</p><p>I enjoy doing that.</p><p>I like doing a whole project.</p><p>This past year I just did <a href=" Bamz</a>'s <em>Sidewalk Exec</em> project, I produced the whole thing; I'm trying to do some more work like that.

<strong>Who are some of your favorite artists you worked with thus far.</strong>

I like working with Bodega Bam.</p><p>We click together.</p><p>Dave East, he works fast.</p><p>Really, like all the artists on The Opiate, I have good chemistry with.</p><p>That’s why I chose them to be on my project.

<strong>What are some of your goals as a producer?</p><p>So do you see yourself maybe getting into like film or other avenues at all?</strong>

I would love to; I would love to get into film because I'm a big movie head.</p><p>I know every classic film, I got every movie.</p><p>So definitely like ultimate goal would be to score a movie.</p><p>And as far as being a producer, yeah, I would like to be mentioned with the greats, the great hip-hop producers, I want my name on that list, you know?

<strong>Here’s the hard question.</p><p>Who would be your top producers?</strong>

Top 5?

<strong>That’s hard as hell, I know.</strong>

It is.</p><p>I would have to say, Alchemist, Dr.</p><p>Dre, Timbaland, Pharell…

<strong>If you notice, a lot of the producers you mentioned are producers that did film scoring – and did mad other shit.</p><p>They went to a whole other level.</p><p>Like Alchemist with Gangrene, you know, doing the score for <i>GTA</i>.</strong>

Oh yeah, and Pharell is a genius.</p><p>He’s like the new Quincy Jones; he’s going to be around forever.</p><p>Would want to take it there, you know.

<strong>So what else do you have coming?</strong>

I have some videos coming up from The Opiate, top of the year.

<strong>What tracks do you have videos for?</strong>

Right now, the Dark Lo track, The Message.</p><p>Honestly, I'm trying to shoot everything off the project, so you want to look out for new videos.</p><p>I also have new drum kits coming out, new sounds.</p><p>Just be on the lookout for upcoming projects man.

<strong>You know, before I learned about you, I'd heard some of your stuff before, but just didn’t realize it was you.</strong>

That’s basically what I'm trying to do right now, let people know who I am.</p><p>People probably heard my stuff, but they didn’t know I did it.

<strong>It’s hard; that’s the hard part about being a producer.</strong>

The producer is stuck in a cut – behind the scenes.

<strong>Yeah, you got to look for it; you've got to know to look for it.</p><p>Like Dre, you just know Dre did it.</p><p>If you're making a Dre track, you make a point of telling everybody it’s a Dre track.</p><p>Artists don’t do that for just anyone.</strong>

Yeah, he broke so many artists.</p><p>He started a lot of things; a lot of times you need to work with an artist that’s going to push your name like that.</p><p>A lot of these new artists, they get what they get from you, and they keep on pushing rather than trying to build.</p><p>Metro Boomin', he got a bunch of people—he got fire, but he also got a bunch of people pushing him too.

<strong>Absolutely.</p><p>As a producer you've got to have the foresight to kind of say, "I think these people are going to make incredible, amazing shit." Like Metro Boomin' is in a good place because a lot of artists he worked with just exploded.</p><p>Like 40's in a great place because Drake just went bonkers, you know what I mean?</strong>

Exactly.</p><p>Like me, I'm a little bit all over the place because I work with so many different artists, but I think that’s going to push me forward.</p><p>When I came in the game, I was doing a lot of stuff for Vado.</p><p>I did a majority of his first couple of mixtapes.</p><p>But then, I don’t know, we just went our ways.

<strong>You never know.</strong>

I'm not mad at him, just you know…



<strong>You just got to have foresight.</p><p>That’s what it is.</p><p>All <i>The Opiate</i> artists, you just click with.</p><p>But, you’ll do tracks with some people, and they’ll be aight, but it just won’t click.</strong>

Yeah, sometimes you just got to find that right… like you said, foresight man; but, sometimes you can have the wrong foresight.

<strong>It's also work ethic.</strong>

And, the game is just different now.</p><p>Shit’s different.</p><p>You'll be cool one day – and then it switches up the next.</p><p>That’s why I choose to work with various artists too because I don’t want to be stuck working with an artist that just ups and leaves.</p><p>I don’t want to be looking at the wall like "This nigga shitted on me." Shit’s crazy, man.

<strong>That happens.</p><p>Look at Guru, before he died, everything he put out was done by Solaar.</p><p>He dumped Premo...who dumps Premo?</strong>

He shitted on him man.</p><p>That’s how you know shit wasn’t right.</p><p>Even other artists shitted on him; Jay-Z, he just stopped working with him out of nowhere, onto the new.

<strong>That’s the progression of hip-hop, too.</strong>

Premo doesn’t change; I mean, once you're legendary, you're going to be legendary regardless.</p><p>But, you've got to switch it up.</p><p>I don’t want to be stuck in that shit with my beats sounding like dinosaurs.

<strong>Well, it’s a different day.</p><p>Things come in cycles.</p><p>If you're a producer that was stuck on 90s shit – and you just didn’t leave that vibe – this is a good time for you right now, you know what I mean?</strong>

I got a little bit of the old stuff in my beats mixed in with the new things.</p><p>I can do trap drums and shit like that, blend it in…I'm just trying to do whatever sounds good to me.</p><p>Got to stay relevant.

<strong>Absolutely.</p><p>You got to stay relevant and just be like 5 percent innovative.</p><p>You've just go to be different enough; you know what I mean?</p><p>So you don’t get bogged down.</p><p>If you're a creative soul, making the same thing all the time will kill you after a while.</strong>

It gets boring.</p><p>You got to add more to it.</p><p>Sometimes you might need a break so that you can come back hard.</p><p>It’s all about who raps on your shit.</p><p>It all goes back to that again.</p><p>What’s the Pusha joint called? <i>Untouchable</i>.</p><p>Like alright, to me, the beat is fire, but you need a rapper on it.</p><p>Not just anyone could kill that beat.

<strong>Yeah, that whole album was on fire – incredible.</strong>

Yeah, I'm glad somebody did it, man, because rap is terrible right now.

<strong>Exactly!</strong>

I'm glad somebody did it.</p><p>Someone on that level… yeah.</p><p>I think that’s regular fire to me.</p><p>His album, a lot of people are supposed to be doing that.</p><p>That’s what people are supposed to be doing, but rap changed.</p><p>It’s not even all the way rap now, it’s just a bunch of genres just blended, you know what I mean?

<strong>Absolutely.</strong>

As far as a rap album, that’s an excellent album.

<strong>That’s the best album I’ve heard in a long time.</p><p>He’s just straight up bars.</strong>

Yeah, people think you can't rap anymore.</p><p>You can rap, but you just got make it sound good.</p><p>Pusha T makes it look good.</p><p>He's got good videos, he’s fresh, he’s talking about real topics.</p><p>You just got to make it look appealing.</p><p>I like the Schoolboy Q's album too that shit was pretty dope.

<strong>I liked that as well.</p><p>TDE in general.</strong>

They're like the new people that’s running rap, man.</p><p>That’s what New York is supposed to be sounding like, TDE shit; but, nobody wants to say that, nobody wants to admit that.</p><p>People want to do shit the same old way they were doing it, but that’s not going to work, anymore.
