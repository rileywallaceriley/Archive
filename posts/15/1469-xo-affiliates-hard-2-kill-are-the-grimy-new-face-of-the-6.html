  <div class="content"><p>If you’re looking for next up groups from the bubbling Toronto landscape, unknown acts from both the OVO and XO camps are a great place to start.</p><p>With acts like Drake, Weeknd, and 2017 W catchers like Belly and Nav, it’s a safe bet that you’ll find quality.</p><p>Two buzz-worthy artists from the 6, Teddy Fantum and G Milla — collectively known as Hard To Kill — are no different, and with their latest cinematic visual making the rounds, it’s easy to see why.

"Slime," the first single from the upcoming self-titled LP sees artists trade aggressive, Bacardi-slanged out verses over a new-age horror-core beat by collective produced by Zepfire, Saintfall, and Teddy himself.</p><p>The visual was shot by Kid.</p><p>Studio, the Toronto film production house behind The Weeknd’s “King of the Fall,” 6lack’s “Ex Calling,” as well as Big Sean’s “Bounce Back,” which was for numerous awards this year—facing off against Kendrick’s “Humble.”

Check out the visual below, and stay tuned for the LP!
