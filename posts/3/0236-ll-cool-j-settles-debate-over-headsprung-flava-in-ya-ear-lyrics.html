  <h1>LL Cool J Settles Debate Over “Headsprung” & "Flava In Ya Ear" Lyrics</h1>
  <div class="meta">2019-09-21 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Apparently, there’s something that had been irking iconic Hip Hop figure LL Cool J for while, and — oddly enough — it’s debate over the lyrics to his 2004 Timbaland-produced single “Headsprung.”https://youtu.be/JQcAzie9AJ0While it’s understandable for people to misinterpret a few words here and there, he notes that literally nobody had a handle on the intro to the song (which was the lead-single for The DEFinition LP).“Let’s end the debate.</p><p>All the lyric sites have it wrong,” Uncle L said via Twitter on Friday (September 20) after laying out the verse properly.</p><p>He even used emojis to add further clarity for those who maybe didn’t understand what he meant.While more than a few asked (rhetorically of course) who had ever actually called him Big Elly, one fan in particular who tweeted, “Girl who has ever debated this intro” actually elicited a passive savage response.“You obviously haven’t,” he wrote. “So just Mind your business beautiful.”Thirteen hours later, LL returned to Twitter to clear up another often misquoted verse intro: the legendary posse cut “Flava In Ya Ear "(Remix)”.Whether or not LL is planning on breaking down other universally misquoted bars remains to be seen.</p><p>But fans seemed especially thankful for his second clarification given the nostalgic grandeur the song still holds firmly.https://youtu.be/PMbELEUfmIACheck out some reactions below.</p></div>
