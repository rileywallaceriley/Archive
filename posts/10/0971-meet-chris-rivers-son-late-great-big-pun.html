  <h1>Meet Chris Rivers, Son Of The Late Great Big Pun</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><p class="p1">Like father like son – it's impossible not to recall this saying when listening to the young rapper Chris Rivers from the Bronx.</p><p>Chris is the son of the Latin multiple-syllable legend Big Pun, who rose to (platinum) prominence in the 90's as a member of the Terror Squad.</p><p>Far from the only child-of-a-rapper out there nowadays (i.e Eazy E's son, Run's kids and even the son of the late ODB), Chris sets himself apart from the pack by striving to create a personal brand that falls outside the shadow of his father's enormous (no <em>pun</em> intended) legacy.</p><p>He's a humble kid who'd been putting in an incredible amount of work, and it shows in the most important place  – his music.</p><p>Check out our interview with Chris Rivers after the jump.</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>Introduce yourself to the people</strong></p>
<p class="p1">What’s good people?</p><p>My name is Chris Rivers, and I’m the son of the late great Big Pun<span class="s1">.</p><p>I’m an artist from the Bronx (the <em>dragon</em>).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Tell me a bit about your background and how you got into Hip-Hop.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Obviously being the son of someone who was so heavily involved in the scene, I was always around it as a child.</p><p>I grew up in studios – but, I mean, he died when I was six, and I wasn’t involved (in music) at that point.</p><p>However, like any child who grew up without a parent will tell you, music fills a void.</p><p>I was always influenced by it, and it's always been a part of my life.</p><p>I’ve always been naturally talented with words and writing and after high-school, about 3-4 years ago, I started to pursue this seriously.</p><p>Thank goodness for the internet – I began releasing music/videos, and they just caught fire.</p><p>I’ve come a long away but know I still have a long way to go.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Who are some of your influences and top artists?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Black thought, Eminem, My Father, Mos Def, Lupe Fiasco – and newer artists like Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole.</p><p>I like stuff with substance and lyrical content.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Talk about your releases thus far.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Wonderland of Misery <a href="http://www.datpiff.com/Chris-Rivers-Wonderland-Of-Misery-mixtape.491676.html">1</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.datpiff.com/Chris-Rivers-Wonderland-Of-Misery-2-mixtape.613789.html">2</a> are available now on DatPiff – and they are an embodiment of myself.</p><p>I took my time on my music.</p><p>You can hear my progression over those two tapes.</p><p>If you want to get a sense of who I am as an artist, definitely get your hands on those.</p><p>I also have the EP that we put on I-Tunes.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Do you, or <em>did</em> you feel any pressure based on who your father is?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">I did feel more pressure when I first started – I mean my dad is a legend, and one of my fave rappers.</p><p>Not just because he’s my dad, but because he’s legitimately one of the best to ever do it.</p><p>I mean I’ll be on the street or on the bus (or whatever) and see people with tattoos of him, and they’ve never even met him.</p><p>To be that iconic is really heavy.</p><p>That being said, I knew that if I was going to do this, that I had to deliver at a certain caliber.</p><p>I knew people would definitely hold me to that, so it’s a gift and a curse.</p><p>It keeps me on my toes, and really motivated me to give my 100%.</p><p>I’ve found that as I’ve grown though, I feel less and less pressure – as I become my own person and become more comfortable with my own identity on the mic.</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>I think it’s admirable that you keep it so, for lack of a better term, <em>100</em> in your music.</p><p>I mean on tracks like<a href="https://soundcloud.com/kevinmadera/chris-rivers-the-destroyer-prod-by-kevin-madera"><em> The Destroyer</em></a>, and<a href="https://soundcloud.com/zareen_53/i-feel-you-chris-rivers"><em> I Feel You</em></a>, you get extremely personal.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">There is definitely a misconception about me – a lot of people think I came up rich or a certain way.</p><p>It's crazy to see people debating on forums and comment sections with me about <em>my life</em>.</p><p>I’ve just tried to keep my music as honest/real as possible.</p><p>I don’t want there to be a separation between the artist and the person.</p><p>Everything I talk about has either happened to me or been witnessed by me – so when you listen to my records, you can know that you’re getting the true story.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>There are a lot of cats around now who are children of famous artists.</p><p>How important was it for you to build a brand outside of your father’s legacy?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">It’s one of the most important things for me and I don’t knock these other guys – I mean I’ve toured with the likes of Young ODB and JoJo (and others).</p><p>They’re all good dudes, and everyone has a different take on it, but I think I have a sense of individuality.</p><p>I’ve always wanted to be my artist, and that holds a lot of weight to me – and that in turn holds weight with other people.</p><p>I mean some cats may be more comfortable paying homage, but I try to stay away from that as far as me establishing my name.</p><p>Maybe later on in my career I’d be more open to things like that, but as of now my brand and image is my priority.</p>
