  <h1>Misappropriation: Who Makes The Rules?</h1>

  <div class="content"><p><blockquote><span style="line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">If Young Thug were white, black Twitter would be losing their f'ing minds.&amp;nbsp;</span></blockquote><p>The term cultural misappropriation has been used frequently in many recent hip-hop conversations.</p><p>Used during a Hot 97 interview with Azalia Banks, and aimed squarely at Iggy Azalea, the term  refers to the convenient use of black culture by "outsiders".</p><p>Is Iggy guilty of using our culture  inappropriately?</p><p>Well, I touched on that already – <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/changed-youre-responsible-iggy-mackelmore/">read up kiddies</a>

But I'll take my opinion a step further.
</p><p>
The idea of cultural misappropriation brings up something else; an elephant in the room that people seem afraid to discuss.</p><p>It's impossible to tear down one white rapper simply for being white – and/or allegedly not possessing authenticity or being fully educated in hip-hop history – without presenting a fully structured set of guidelines.</p><p>What does one have to do to get a pass?</p><p>Which white rappers are acceptable and why?
</p><p>
There are plenty of white roots in hip-hop.</p><p>Eminem, most notably, is one of the most successful rappers of all-time.</p><p>How about El-P, Beastie Boys or Ra The Rugged Man?</p><p>How about MC Serch?</p><p>He's often acknowledged as the one who gave Nas his first break.</p><p>How about long-time Mobb Deep associate Alchemist?</p><p>How about we talk about individuals like Steve Rifkind, who brought us WU-Tang and Mobb Deep and Mike Weiss who brought us acts like Black Moon and Mad Lion.</p><p>How about Rick Ruben?</p><p>Those last three were executives, but you know what?</p><p>They've done more for the genre than you (likely) have!
</p><p>
Listen, good music is good music, and bad music is bad music.</p><p>Ignorant music knows no boundaries.</p><p>If Young Thug were white, black Twitter would be losing their f'ing minds.</p><p>There's a new breed of white rappers like Mac Miller and Action Bronson who, like it or not, are exploding.</p><p>They – arguably – have a pass.</p><p>All I'm saying is that we need to define as a culture why it's acceptable for them to exist without argument, but Iggy can't do what, in all honesty, a million and one other black artists are already doing. 
</p><p>
I just think that we need to be careful here – especially when trying to define who can do what.</p><p>Unless hip-hop is going to stop taking money from white America, we can't really protest them being a part of the machine.</p><p>Standards of (cultural) hip-hop knowledge, authenticity and artistic merit should be set across the board, and stand regardless of race.</p><p>Because without some more strict definition...we just sound like a bunch of haters.</p><p>Sorry, not sorry.
</p><p>
No shade – and let me say, I'm a real head.</p><p>I'm on your side (yes you reading this with the screw face on).</p><p>I just think that the front lines of our culture needs to be more organized when opening a can worms like this.</p><p>If you missed my last post in why Iggy is your fault, <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/changed-youre-responsible-iggy-mackelmore/">click here</a>.
