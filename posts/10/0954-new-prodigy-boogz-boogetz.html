  <h1>New Prodigy & Boogz Boogetz</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Soulful stoner music – that's the best way we begin to tell you about <em>Young Rollin Stoners</em> the collaborative album between Prodigy, one half of Mobb Deep and Far Rockaway's own Boogz Boogetz.</p><p>The two, who have collaborated extensively in the past have pulled together 11 piff-laced soundscapes that are sure to please both Mobb and Boogetz fan.
<!--more-->
Standouts are the ultra smooth trip down memory lane, <em>40oz</em>, the soulful (love) song <em>Pass Me</em> and the Mobb Deepish <em>Scarface</em>.</p><p>P sounds like he hasn't missed a step 20 years later, which is a good look for Boogz.</p><p>What should be noted is that Boogz and P are very levelled on this project – that is to say that neither is ever overshadowed ; however, this isn't the first time Boogz has spit with big-time artists.</p><p>His 2010 DJ Khaled hosted debut had names like Ace Hood and Wiz Khalifa on it.</p><p>But the way we see it, collaborative projects are a tricky beast that either work or don't.</p><p>Red and Meth, Skyzoo and Torae...sheesh even Snoop and Wiz are joint ventures that make so much sense you wish you'd thought of it first.</p><p>P and Boogz fit well together, and <em>Young Rollin' Stoners</em> proves it.
