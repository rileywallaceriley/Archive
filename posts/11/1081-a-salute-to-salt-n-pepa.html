  <h1>A Salute To Salt-N-Pepa</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><blockquote>"Fight for your rights, stand up and be heard...</p><p>You’re just as good as any man, believe that, word."

– Salt-N-Pepa (from the song None Of Your Business)</blockquote>
Hip-hop music has had an abundance of fundamental shifts in sound, tone and subject matter over the past 40 years.</p><p>Most have been so severe that they ultimately spelled professional doom for many artists who tried to keep up with the times by simply rolling over and – metaphorically – letting the styles engulf their being.</p><p>Some of the most notable shifts were the rise of NewJack Swing, the rise of Gangsta Rap, the shift to Jiggy, and the most recent rise of drill and trap music.</p><p>Golden era artists had it the absolute worst.</p><p>While many were able to spot the sell-out nature of the almost gimmicky nature of many hip-hop sub-genres, and maintain a timeless backpack/underground aesthetic we still knock today, some of your fave rappers either went out trying to fit into the gangsta mold, or as new jack swinging casanovas in a fly zoot suits.</p><p>To see any artist from the 80’s still making any sort of noise today, really speaks to their ability to make relevant music across all the sub-genres, and stay true to – and to see any female artists (in hip-hop) still maintaining relevance is, well, that much more remarkable.</p><p>I’d like to take some time to focus on one female group in particular: Salt-N-Pepa.
