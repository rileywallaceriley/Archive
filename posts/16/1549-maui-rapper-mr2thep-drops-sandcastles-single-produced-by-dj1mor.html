  <div class="content"><p>As he feverishly plugs away at the tweaks on his brand new LP produced entirely by longtime friend, L.A. based producer and DJ 1mor -- host of CashOnly Radio, which airs Thursdays from 8-9 pm on Dash Radio -- Mr2TheP drops a brand new single "SANDCASTLES," complete with an introduction to his latest hat, videography.

The Orange County-born Maui rapper tells AAHH that the album -- tentatively titled <em>LSP </em>-- was mostly recorded in a short period. " produced while 1mor was staying with me at the compound in Maui," he says -- recalling the sessions at his Maui studio, which he christened last year with his deeply personal musical-journey (album) Island Fever.</p><p>He relocated to the Central Pacific island in 2017 and beginning building the creative hub after the loss of his daughter

"You was hoping that I'd stop and fumble, what ... because I'm middle-aged dope and don't f*cking mumble?" -- Mr2theP, "SANDCASTLES"

The visual for the super cool single was shot via iPhone X with anamorphic lens and edited by P himself, is -- according to him -- beyond a display of his creativity, a taste of what's to come. "I recently took up video directing, and I'm looking to expand on my visuals this year, crafting videos to some of the significant features I'm sitting on," he says.</p><p>He's mum about the features themselves, preferring to show and prove, allowing the product to speak for itself; however, based on his track record, which includes a discography packed with quality releases (and collaborations with Daylyt among others), we're in for something special.</p><p>Check out the video, above.</p></div>
