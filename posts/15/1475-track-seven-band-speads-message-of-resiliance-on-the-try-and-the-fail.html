  <h1>Track Seven Band Speads Message Of Resiliance On “The Try And The Fail”</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Track Seven Band is a Group that I’ve covered numerous times here on AAHH as their debut project’s lifeline has been given a few extensions with visual treatments and live performances.</p><p>This past week, they dropped their final video from the project, the title track — “The Try An The Fail.”

The EP is — in case you missed my editorial — a slice of resilience, a call to action, and a cathartic chunk of musical therapy for the band’s lead singer, Cost, who among other things, confronted the loss of his mother to cancer on the seven-song project.
<blockquote>Don’t give up it will be alright, as long as you have life you gon’ put up that fight. —Cost</blockquote>
“The Try And The Fail” was the project’s anthem of hope in the face of seemingly insurmountable adversity.</p><p>The video treatment attempts to illustrate that from many angles; there’s a range of examples presented in the 3-minute clip, from the stand against injustice in Ferguson to the iconic image of the late Muhammad Ali standing above the vanquished Sonny Liston — an iconic image of victory/perseverance that has endured for decades.</p><p>The video, more than anything, takes the lyrics, which (in the verses) focus mainly on Cost’s drive to overcome his obstacles, and globalize them into a call for unification.</p><p>Whether it be against greater systems of oppression, or rampant social issues that affect not only our well-being but collective (and generational) future, it’s a plead to keep it moving regardless of what happens.</p><p>Given the climate of today’s world, which feels as though it’s one false move away from imploding, the song seems like a necessary injection of positive energy.</p><p>It’s a powerful message, and — as the EP’s final single — a fitting end to the project’s promotional run.</p><p>There hasn’t been a date set in stone for the release of the impending LP, but if you haven’t been up on Track Seven Band, definitely do yourself a favor and check out their project, <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/indiespotlight-track-seven-band-the-try-and-the-fail/">here</a>.
