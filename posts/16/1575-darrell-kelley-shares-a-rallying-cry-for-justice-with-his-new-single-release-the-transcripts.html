  <h1>Darrell Kelley Shares A Rallying Cry For Justice With His New Single "Release The Transcripts"</h1>

<p>Black lives matter — and the fight for justice is far from over.</p><p>This is the message emanating from the new single "Release The Transcripts" by musician, ordained bishop, entrepreneur, and social activist Darrell Kelley.</p><p>A prominent muse for the song's emotionally charged rallying cry is&amp;nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://thehill.com/person/breonna-taylor" rel="noreferrer noopener">Breonna Taylor</a>, a 26-year-old Black woman shot and killed by police in her Louisville home this past March.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The call for the release of the transcripts stems from the controversial motion that was filed by Atty.</p><p>Gen.</p><p>Daniel Cameron to delay the release of transcripts and audio from the grand jury's inquiry into the killing; though such a release is generally unusual, a separate motion filed by an unidentified juror argued that there was a "compelling public interest" to have the grand jury record released.</p><p>It also accused Cameron of "using the grand jury to deflect accountability and responsibility for  decisions."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A judge granted the delay so that Cameron's offices could redact personal information of people who were part of the proceedings.</p><p>Audio of the proceedings (which totals over 20 hours) was finally released on October 2, 2020 — although an actual transcription has yet to surface. </p>

<p>Still, as Darrell Kelley makes quite clear, justice was far from served in this case — with two officers walking and one facing charges for the shots that didn't hit <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://thehill.com/person/breonna-taylor">Breonna</a>.</p><p>Blatant injustice is an ongoing issue nationwide; never has unity been more critical. </p>
