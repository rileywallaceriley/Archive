<p>"<em>This release of the "Things Can't Stay The Same" music video marks the end of the 'Phone Calls Give Me Anxiety' phase of music.</p><p>The video indicates the halfway point to the next evolution of my music.</p><p>Think of it as a break up from the old constructs of conciseness in love &amp; life in my last release.</p><p>This exodus frees me to explore life in its most uninhibited form on these next new releases.</p><p>I'm so excited about where we are, but more excited for what's to come.</em>"&amp;nbsp;</p>
