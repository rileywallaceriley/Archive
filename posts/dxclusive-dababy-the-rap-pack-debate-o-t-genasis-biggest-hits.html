    <div class="content"><p>While speaking to Carl Chery, Trent Clark and Jon Tanners of Los Angeles-based The Rap Pack podcast, Hip Hop heavyweight DaBaby and the crew took a few minutes to debate the most significant singles by Long Beach, California-native O.T. Genasis.Spurned by Spotify's Top 10 rap song list of the decade, his two most well-known tracks, "CoCo" and "Cut It" were pitted against each other."You gotta find room for O.T.</p>
<p>Genasis 'CoCo,'" the "Suge" rapper noted.https://youtu.be/6vYnas6q3SgChery began the debate, adding in "I'll put 'Cut It' over 'CoCo,'" before clarifying that the deciding factor of superiority is -- of course -- impact. "I think there are too many songs above 'CoCo' in terms of impact ... like if we were to break down the criteria (quality, impact sales, everything), I think there's a lot of songs over 'CoCo.'"If we're isolating 'CoCo' versus 'Cut It,' I think 'CoCo's' aged badly. I think it's a little bit of a novelty now," Chery adds. "I haven't heard 'CoCo' in a minute ... but 'Cut It' was a slow burn.</p>
<p>It just hung around. It was just like, it just wouldn't go anywhere.""You think 'CoCo' went somewhere?</p>
<p>How many times you used to hear that," DaBaby replied. "Honestly, he come with them hits man ... he does."https://youtu.be/qMwcsIY1GYEThe platinum-selling breakout 2014 hit "CoCo" peaked at number 20 on the US Billboard Hot 100 -- spawning two official remixes branded as part two and three respectively (one featuring Meek Mill and Jeezy and the other featuring Chris Brown). The Young Dolph-featured "Cut It" failed to achieve as big a Billboard success, though it outsold "CoCo," earning certified double-platinum status August of 2017 (roughly two years after it first dropped).The full episode of The Rap Pack podcast featuring DaBaby drops Tuesday (December 17) on all platforms.</p></div>
