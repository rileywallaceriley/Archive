Fadi Abouabsi – aka FDAmusic –born is an emerging Arabic hip-hop artist hailing from Houston, Texas.</p><p>He, along with his partner B-Luce, founded their own Independent label Overgrind Records at the tender age of eighteen; together, FDAmusic and B-Luce dropped over six releases and generated a ton of interest.</p><p>FDA took things to the next level, though, after his hit single <i>Trap House</i> generated over 500,000 hits via YouTube.</p><p>His solo album, “Made It,” sold over 5,000 hard copies and 20,000 digital copies online.</p><p>Not bad, right?</p><p>Fresh off of the release of his solo album <i>Fame</i>, I had the pleasure of taking in his newest EP, <i>Keep It 1000</i>.</p><p>It's a solid collection of tracks, with heavy hitting trap production and features from the likes of "Mr.</p><p>Never Tired" himself, Kevin Gates, on <i>I Know It</i>, and Billboard top 100 artist – and 2013 XXL Freshman – Kirko Bangz, on the "steal your girl" anthem, <i>All Into Her.</i> The EP is a poignant message to rappers who talk a good game, but are ultimately unable to live up to the opulence and street life they preach.</p><p>He also spends a great deal of time highlighting his hustle, on tracks such as <i>Grind</i> and <i>No Time</i>, where he drops bars like: <em>"no time to turn up, this hustle isn't a side grind."</em> While you're out partying, FDA is putting in work.</p><p>That`s probably why his social networks are revving and buzzing like chainsaws.</p><p>Indeed, he's focused, primed, and taking no prisoners.</p><p>The name of the project alone, suggests that he's curbing the supposed authenticity of his peers, which seems to suit him just fine.</p><p>The trust issues he discusses at various points throughout the project are likely due to the industry's obsession with keeping it "100" for the gram.</p><p>With a solo-dolo work ethic, crisp accompanying visuals and features definitely beyond the budget of your favourite neighbourhood rapper, FDA's stroll to the to the top of the pack looks leisurely.</p><p>Early.
