This is my second time round with DC-native Vin-O. Last year I took you guys through his record <i>Death Of A Poet, Birth Of A Gamesta</i>, which was a super impressive listen.</p><p>As I mentioned last time, his bio benefited from a co-sign and worked with producer Chuckie Thompson.</p><p>Chuckie's catalogue includes monster records like the "Flava In Ya Ear Remix" and "Big Poppa" from the heyday of Bad Boy Entertainment — and most recently the Biggie and Faith "collabo" <i>The</i> <i>King</i> <i>&amp;</i> <i>I</i>.</p><p>I had high hopes for his latest project, <i>Truth</i>, <i>Understanding</i>, <i>Poetry</i>, <i>And</i> <i>Culture</i>, which is actually a clever acronym for Tupac.</p><p>I wasn't let down.</p><p>At 22 songs in length, there is a lot to get through.</p><p>If you follow my writing, you'll know how I feel about projects of this length; they demand quite a lot of attention.</p><p>It's a reason that many writers I know were shying away from reviewing the new DJ Khaled record.</p><p>And that's a star-studded affair — so imagine how most would react to a lesser known act?</p><p>I digress.</p><p>While he may have tried to do a little too much on this LP, it's done well.</p><p>There is a healthy balance of self-actualization, retrospective outlook, love, storytelling, and real life shit.</p><p>Production is solid, and helps him bob and weave through subject matter without it become too jarring.</p><p>There are standouts as you commit to the project.</p><p>The "Welcome To The Mardi Gras" sampled "SummaTime N Da City" is grittier take on a seasonal ode.</p><p>I could easily see this becoming one of the singles. "Sometimes I sit back and go wonder, could we not have a single Murder the whole summer," he ponders on the track's third verse.</p><p>Another big tune was "Me N My Mans," which reminds me a lot of the Tupac track, "Pour Out A Lil' Liquor," if only just content wise.</p><p>The production stands out, to me.

"Infamous" is another big song that comes quite early on in the track list.</p><p>Notably, O notes that Chuckie gave him a beat meant for Biggie; however, he isn't specific on which beat.</p><p>That sounds like a whole story in itself

Other must-listen tracks are the piano-driven "Born Winner," "3:10 AM in Forestville," and the third-eye-open vibe of "Cold," with its jazzy drum pattern.</p><p>Overall, it's a solid release.</p><p>Honest, detailed, and deeply personal at points.</p><p>He also still manages to intersperse tracks like "Paranoia," which is more of a club/street song.</p><p>Vin-O is far from one-dimensional, which is refreshing!</p><p>Early!
