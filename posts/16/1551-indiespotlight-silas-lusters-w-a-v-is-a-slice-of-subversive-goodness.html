  <div class="content"><p>Provincetown, Massachusetts, MC Silas Luster released a brand new EP <em>W.A.V.</em> on March 29th that I've meant to share my thoughts on, but to be honest, it was a dense listen.</p><p>Not in an unapproachable way, mind you.</p><p>Instead, it's like an onion made of many, discussion worthy layers, painted atop lush soundscapes that are (at points) reminiscent of OG EL-P production from the early Def Juxx days.

&amp;nbsp;
The EP kicks off with "Sion," which starts with his wordy flow over a head-nodding instrumental that switches up halfway through, into this bongo drum pattern over which he drops the strongest verse easily on the project; I'd love to see it live. "Diewittit" is another song that I found myself revisiting over and over.</p><p>His cadence and rhyme schemes at times have this loose appeal that reminds me of the Freestyle Fellowship-esque aura that dominated college radio in the 90s.


&amp;nbsp;
He speaks a lot about his journey, and also a lot of spiritual topics -- from the universe to putting meditation over medicine.</p><p>It's a lot to unpack, in a good way.</p><p>You can hear the spoken word elements that seem to be the backbone of his bars -- check the acapella interlude "What's Love?" as a great example of what I mean.</p><p>The almost haunting chorus on "O.S.H.N" wasn't necessarily jarring but did set the song apart as a black sheep of the EP.</p><p>Not that it's a bad song -- it's one of the strongest tracks -- but, it's just a different vibe that stuck out to me.</p><p>Overall, I dig this EP a lot.</p><p>If you find yourself a little inundated with the sea of Lil rappers, and the endless sea of meh that often dominates the mainstream consciousness, Silas offers up a slice of subversive Hip Hop.</p><p>It's music crafted to both cathartically get things off of his chest and also get your thinking -- depending on your aptitude on some of his topics, maybe even get you googling and reading shit.</p><p>He is currently touring throughout New England and the Tri-State.</p><p>Check the schedule.
