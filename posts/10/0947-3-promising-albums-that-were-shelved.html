  <h1>3 promising 90's albums that were shelved</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sat, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>The music industry is a weird beast with a shaky temperament.</p><p>Picture this – you're living out your dream, recording a major label   album.</p><p>Features are rolling in, money is flowing, ads are printed.</p><p>It's all in place and a release date is announced; however, that date comes and goes.</p><p>Days go by, the buzz wears off and fickle fans move on to the next artist in line.</p><p>This happens, a lot.</p><p>Here are just a few examples of promising artists or were (extremely) pushed back, and in one case shelved.

<strong>Charlie Baltimore</strong>

Let's go back in time – Charlie Baltimore was in a great place in the 90's.</p><p>She was the girl in the <em><a href="http://youtu.be/etMpCz8eql8">Get Money</a></em> video and considered to be Biggie's "protégé", she was down with Horse and Carriage Cam'Ron and, shit, she was even rumoured to have been in the ill-fated "Commission" with Biggie and Jigga.</p><p>Things looked up and up.</p><p>She was in the studio working on her <em><a href=" As Ice</a></em> album, that included singles like <em>Stand Up</em> featuring Ghostface Killah and <em>Feel It</em> feat Teddy Riley – not to mention numerous ads/posters.</p><p>So what went wrong?</p><p>Creative differences between Baltimore and the record label (Untertainment), and further complications forced the album to be shelved; however it was leaked online.</p><p>Charli released the album on iTunes herself over a decade later – better late than never.

<strong>Young Zee</strong>

Newark New Jersey native, Young Zee, was/is a member of the Outsidaz – a team that boasted members like young Eminem, Rah Digga and Pace Won.</p><p>Zee seemed primed to be a breakout artist, with a unique style/voice, a single in rotation on BET and The Box and even a feature on the multi-platinum Fugees album The Score.</p><p>His debut album on Perspective Records, <em><a href=" Meltdown</a></em>, featured production by Ski Beatz, KRS-One and Twista with appearances by Lauryn Hill, Busta Rhymes, and KRS-One.</p><p>So what went wrong?</p><p>Well, back when the Source had mad integrity – and pretty much ran the magazine game – they gave Young Zee a less-than-glowing review.</p><p>In fact, that's putting it mildly, they basically tore the album up so bad that the label eventually decided to shelve the project; however, the album is actually ridiculously dope.</p><p>Tracks like Stay Gold featuring Lauren Hill and Electric Chair feat Pace Won are must listens!

<strong>Cuban Link</strong>

Big Pun is a legend, no argument.</p><p>When he started out, he was in a crew called Full Of Clips with partners in rhyme Cuban Link and Triple Seis.</p><p>Obviously Pun stuck out, but Cuban was his right hand, and was a part of many projects.</p><p>Being part of the Terror Squad eventually led to a solo project entitled <em><a href=" which featured Pun, Ja Rule and many more heavyweights and close Terror Squad affiliates.</p><p>Everything was falling into place – and then we were faced with Pun's untimely death.</p><p>Unfortunately for Cuban, his relationship with Terror Squad capo Fat Joe virtually fell apart without Pun, and so did his deal, leading his album to be indefinitely shelved; although a few singles/videos did surface from the project, including <em>Still Tellin' Lies</em> featuring Tony Sunshine, which actually faired quite well.</p><p>If you google it out, you can find a copy of the album advance, it's actually a decent listen.
