  <h1>Unsigned Hype: King Callis</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>An Ohio native – Akron, Ohio to be exact – King Callis started writing music at the age of 10; however it wasn't until his teenage years that he started actually recording his music and taking it seriously.</p><p>The move to Charlotte, North Carolina, and later meeting a few key players in the underground music scene gave Callis the breakthrough he needed to cement him into the scene as a major player.</p><p>Callis' sound mirrors that of the late 90's Common Sense or Slum Village, with his own added flavor thrown in.</p><p>That is what's truly given him an advantage over many of the artists that surround him.</p><p>His strength lies in his ability to engage a crowd, while giving food for thought – and making them come back for much more.
