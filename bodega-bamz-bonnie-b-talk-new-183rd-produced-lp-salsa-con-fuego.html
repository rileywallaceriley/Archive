    <h1>Bodega Bamz & Bonnie B Talk New 183rd-Produced LP "Salsa Con FUEGO"</h1>
    <div class="meta">2019-09-16 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Fresh off of the release of Bodega's Way (a collaborative EP with producer Salaam Remi), Spanish Harlem native Bodega Bamz and his artist Bonnie B are prepping their new project Salsa Con FUEGO — produced entirely by 183rd. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euj9wVOgC9UAccording to Bonnie, the title of the project is especially fitting. "Salsa Con FUEGO ... think about it, the name of the project speaks for itself," she tells HipHopDX. "We them Latin motherfuckers that are fire, period." The process of creating the project was something the duo both describe as exceptionally fluid and fun. "I've known 183rd for over a decade," Bamz notes. "I met him before he started producing. So it's been fun ... very organic.</p>
<p>That's why the music came out fire. He respects the vision." Bonnie adds, "183rd made all the beats from scratch in every session.</p>
<p>It was a fun experience." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjU_m3SSDF8Bonnie and Bamz first connected back in 2014 when Bonnie was about three years into her career. "Rapping was a secret passion of mine," she says, adding that she started as a socialite hosting parties and events in the lower east side. "I saw a few artists rising out of the underground scene, so I decided to drop a record and see what the feedback was." It was her work as an event planner that put her on Bamz's radar. "I discovered Bonnie downtown at party. She had a lot of woman with her looking like a female pimp," he says. "I saw some of her music videos and said, 'Nah shorty is dope, I see potential here.'" Initially connecting with Bamz's brother Ohla (a producer and videographer) Bonnie was brought into the fold of the Tanboys movement -- a collective of artists that includes Bamz, Ohla, Lil’ Eto, Kanary Black, Tanboy Luka and Rossi Rock (among others).</p>
<p>She's also the face of the brand's counterpart, Tangirls.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV0H4N0-YU4The two have collaborated numerous times, but this is their first collaborative full-length body of work. "He always pushes me to exceed outside of my comfort zone," Bonnie says of working Bamz. "When we collaborate, it's a whole nostalgic vibe. We grew up on the late 90s and early 2000s Hip Hop, so we are always playing around with old rap or R&B melodies — but giving it that tan sound." Bodega Bamz, Bonnie B and 183rd's Salsa Con FUEGO is dropping soon.</p>
