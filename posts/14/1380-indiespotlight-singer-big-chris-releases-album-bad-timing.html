  <h1>#IndieSpotlight: Singer Big Chris Releases Album 'Bad Timing'</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><blockquote>"Big Chris' album is straight fire from start to end.</p><p>Real R&amp;B music!</p><p>This gonna be in a lane of its own." - The Swede - 808 Mafia</blockquote>
UK based singer Big Chris is a pleasant surprise; His last single "F The World" dropped over the summer , but now his new record is out and features a ton of quality content, with a fresh dose of old-school R&amp;B sensibility.</p><p>Sitting at eight tracks in length--and featuring "F The World" as a closer--he explores solid songwriting and traverses quality and cohesive production on standouts like "Shoosh," the tile track, and "Home Tonight." At points, it has a late 90s feeling to it; it's a good balance.</p><p>Recorded by Big Chris and John Robinson at Clique Studios, London and Miami Live, Miami.</p><p>The album mix was finalised by Mixbytrip at Circle House Miami.</p><p>Inspirations of The Dream, Mike Posner and R Kelly can be heard throughout.</p><p>Definitely put this project on your weekly playlist if you're down for some quality R&amp;B; Big Chris has something special here.
