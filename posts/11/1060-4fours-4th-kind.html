  <h1>Four4s - 4th Kind</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hip-hop is worldwide – and sometimes it’s easy to get pigeonholed by a local mentality when it comes to&amp;nbsp;the genre.</p><p>Hip-hop is bigger than the US and Canadian markets,&amp;nbsp;which we are&amp;nbsp;understandably serviced on a regular basis.&amp;nbsp;Specifically, the UK hip-hop market is a sea of creativity and originality.</p><p>The core of its influence is interesting, as it has elements of golden era legends across two continents, so the subject matter and overall vibe tends to vary vastly.</p><p>I’ve been thinking of expanding our unsigned hype for a while, but have been (admittedly) intimidated, as I had an entire lifeline of hip-hop to catch up on.</p><p>Fortunately, a very dope project landed on my desk, so it was as good a time as any to focus on some dope audio candy from London-town.&amp;nbsp;Meet Four4s, the duo of childhood bredrens, Abstrax and Timi RS.</p><p>They have bars, a very cool underground vibe, and a great new batch of tunes.&amp;nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Their new LP, <em>4th Kind</em>, is 17 joints long, with no filler/interludes – just bars.</p><p>They list their influences as&amp;nbsp;Wu-Tang,&amp;nbsp;KRS ONE, Big pun,&amp;nbsp;Nas, Big L, which is actually quite evident as I listened to this album.</p><p>As much as this&amp;nbsp;project is a melting pot of sounds and styles, it’s all hip-hop – &amp;nbsp;and benefits from the cohesive sound and feel orchestrated entirely by Abstrax.</p><p>I'm a <strong>huge</strong> fan of projects with a single producer.</p><p>When asked to describe their sound, the duo offered the following: "<em>It's anger, passion, and fun mixed with a touch of sadness at times.</em>” They further describe that their tone/subject matter stems from their views of the current industry on a whole. "<em>There’s a lot of negativity amongst&amp;nbsp;the youth of today’s world… And artists are&amp;nbsp;taught to become characters molded by the media.</p><p>Losing our own independent minds, we've become&amp;nbsp;a man made generation.</em>” This project seems devoid of much commercial influence,&amp;nbsp;but is rather a gritty&amp;nbsp;ride-along with two English&amp;nbsp;kids trying to live their dreams in a world where creative minds are often set-up to fail.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This thought process is all over this project.</p><p>They tackle everything from the consequences of negative decisions, street life, overcoming adversity, crew love, loss, happiness, stage fright – and overall just some <em>real-life shit</em>.</p><p>It’s refreshing as hell, in all honesty.</p><p>The vibe is quite cinematic, with lots of sonic experimentation, ambient sounds and breakdowns.</p><p>There are a few stand-outs  for me: The album opener <a href="https://soundcloud.com/four4smusic/im-home?in=four4smusic/sets/4th-kind"><em>I’m Home</em></a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/four4smusic/yeah-to-the-bullshit?in=four4smusic/sets/4th-kind"><em>Yeah To The Bullshit</em></a>, which illustrates how the duo deals with, well, bullshit, the retrospective <a href="https://soundcloud.com/four4smusic/time-in-my-life-ft-tenesan?in=four4smusic/sets/4th-kind"><em>Time In My Life</em></a> featuring talented singer Tenesan and lastly the slamming <a href="https://soundcloud.com/four4smusic/so-strong?in=four4smusic/sets/4th-kind"><em>So Strong</em></a> (currently on repeat here at the&amp;nbsp;office). &amp;nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>4th Kind</em> is the second release from the duo, and I was so impressed by this one, that I’m going to explore their back catalogue a bit more.</p><p>The project is definitely worth a cover to cover spin – or maybe even two. &amp;nbsp;</span></p>
