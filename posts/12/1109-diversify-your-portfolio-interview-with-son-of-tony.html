  <h1>Diversify Your Portfolio: Interview With Son of Tony</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>History has shown that the most successful artists in hip-hop history have worn multiple hats.</p><p>Whether that means heading label, businesses (like Rick Ross’ Wing Stop for example) – or even making a go at other forms of media such as film, TV or radio.</p><p>In today’s fickle marketplace, and as hip-hop/music has evolved into a billion dollar industry, not diversifying your portfolio seems almost irresponsible, especially if your goals involve longevity and financial stability.</p><p>Meet Son of Tony, whose stage name is in loving memory of his late father.</p><p>He's quite an interesting artist – especially when we're talking about "diversity." Aside from multiple releases, including his most recent <em><a href="https://t.co/qmpnCO2fM8">The Son And His Father</a></em>, he’s also a veteran radio host in Ohio, who helped start and co-host <em>Flip &amp; Flex Radio</em>, and <em>Xclusive Vibe Radio</em> on Power 109.9.</p><p>He’s a well-rounded cat, with a determination to get his messages out to the masses – by any means necessary.</p><p>AAHIPHOP caught up with him to chat about his career and his latest music.</p><p>Check the interview below.

<strong>How did you get involved in hip-hop music?
</strong>
I got involved in music through my family.</p><p>Always hearing what they were playing around me – and songs that caught my attention during big scenes in movies.</p><p>It helped to influence me.</p><p>I started writing at ten.</p><p>I just never saw myself serious about it until 2014.</p><p>The most natural gift I have, I never chased.</p><p>I got involved in music to change my life.</p><p>Something in my confidence changed.</p><p>I just know I make the kind of music that can compete with what's being played today.


<strong>You're an interesting artist because you're also an established radio personality.</p><p>How does that influence your approach to music?
</strong>
Radio changed my approach to music.</p><p>I listened to so many submissions for the station, I heard so much lack of respect, copycatting, and false promotion of the unworthy, I set out to change that.</p><p>I focused on releasing a project I knew would get a response.</p><p>I hosted a radio show on Power 1099, Flip &amp; Flex radio, in Ohio last year called Xclusive Vibe Radio.</p><p>This was a significant turning point for me.</p><p>Not just because of the profession or listeners, but because of what was being said in so much of the music.</p><p>So, I started writing and recording about my life.</p><p>It's personal, it's Hip Hop, but I’m in it for the money and the opportunities.</p><p>Somebody, somewhere, can relate to at least one song on the project.</p><p>It was written with a worldly view.</p><p>Having radio and product to sell is a force to be acknowledged.</p><p>It changes the odds a little.


<strong>How did you get into radio?</p><p>What is your take on the role radio plays in today's hip-hop landscape?
</strong>
What radio considers to be hot today is not a true reflection of the total climate of Hip Hop.</p><p>It focuses more on sound, hook, dance, and fashion.</p><p>Not substance.</p><p>Not the message.</p><p>Sometimes we have to remind people that Hip Hop originates from the streets of New York.</p><p>That Hip Hop will always belong to the streets.</p><p>No matter how much globalization you attach to it.</p><p>This music landscape is fickle.</p><p>So many underground artists never get the shot for that great talent because it's about how much can be made off you and your image.</p><p>It's about money, not talent.</p><p>And this makes it tougher for us all.

<strong>Tell me about The Father &amp; His Son project.
</strong>
The Son And His Father Tape is different.</p><p>The aggression.</p><p>The beat selection.</p><p>The content.</p><p>For a debut project, it's incredibly versatile, while remaining true to the messages.</p><p>It's real life.</p><p>It's cinematic.</p><p>It's violent without overkill.</p><p>Raw and honest.</p><p>My life put out there for all to hear.</p><p>The pain and glory of it all.</p><p>Somebody has to carry the torch for the people who make music this generation can relate to.</p><p>So many concepts to choose from.</p><p>Any one song is full of discussion matter.</p><p>They will all understand the strength of this project in due time.</p><p>There’s a lot of new music that’s out to compete with.</p><p>I'm holding steady. 

<strong>What are your goals as a music artist?
</strong>
My goal is to reach the underdog.</p><p>The downtrodden.</p><p>The abused and forgotten.</p><p>The poor and rich alike, though.</p><p>There're levels to my music.</p><p>I want to sell out arenas.</p><p>Collab with greats who helped to mold the culture.</p><p>I want to be known as one of the authentics.</p><p>The one with original style, sound, and subject matter.</p><p>In short, I just want to be the best artist I can be, without selling my soul.</p><p>That's not negotiable.

<strong>Do you see yourself remaining independent – or pursuing a major deal?</p><p>Do you think labels still matter in 2015?
</strong>
Who's to say if the right situation comes along that I won't sign with a major.</p><p>Until then, I’m independent.</p><p>I'm unsigned.</p><p>I'm hungry.</p><p>If you’re not in this for the money, why be here?</p><p>I'm writing, recording, and performing until I amass a fortune.</p><p>And yes, labels still matter.</p><p>Those are machines with all the avenues and unlimited resources, but independent still matters too.</p><p>We still set trends and the "bar" as well.
