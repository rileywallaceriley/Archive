  <h1>Kaiju The Unconquerable Returns With Ultraman Visual</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Kaiju The Unconquerable is an alumnus of my #indiespotlight series from last year when he released "Episode 6"—a dope mini-movie that anyone into Anime/comics/ninja type shit should revisit.</p><p>He just sent "Episode 7: Ultraman" my way, and it’s fantastic.

This time around, the story centers on Zenith, a 27-year-old Ultraman stationed in the US.</p><p>He became an Ultraman after his father attempted to tamper with the gene and ultimately ended up dying in an attempt to distill and use its power.</p><p>Fast forward; Zenith is the only one with this power (on this side of the world), and—in the course of the six-minute mini film fights a deadly alien, lighting up the NYC skyline in the process.

It’s, literally as rad as it sounds.</p><p>From his Ultraman arms and mask—which are insanely cool—to his Ultraman letterman jacket, which I would kill for, the visual is engaging, not unlike his past material.</p><p>He also directed it, which needs to be acknowledged.</p><p>Much like his previous work, which I discussed before, Kaiju’s image and music play off of each other but don’t depend on each other, at all.</p><p>DOOM is DOOM, that’s his character.</p><p>This song, for example, is a really dope song as a stand-alone; if you were to listen to just the song, you might take Ultraman as a metaphor--among many others in the lyrically dense track--and rock with it.</p><p>The video is what makes it literal. "Ultraman" is a really (really) good song, I can’t stress that enough.</p><p>Kaiju may come across as niche if you peruse through his catalog, but he’s extremely accessible.</p><p>Recommend content—really sit with this one.</p><p>Early!</p></div>
