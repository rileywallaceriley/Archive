  <div class="meta">2019-05-16 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Pharrell Williams and Scott Vener's OTHERtone hosted a live conversation with Virginia Beach music royalty Teddy Riley, and fellow-natives Pusha T, and Chad Hugo during the Something In The Water community festival on April 26.In the video, published on Wednesday (May 18), a standout moment came when Timbaland told a story about his first being blown away by Pharrell's production."I remember I came in the back door  ...</p><p>Missy  was in there doing something, and I passed by an open door and heard 'I hate you so much right now,'" Timbaland explains, describing his reaction to Kelis' breakout single "Caught Out There" -- produced (and written) by Pharrell and Chad.He added that he made Missy come over and hear it and though she tried to coax him over to their studio to get to work, he says, "I was done for the night."A humbled Pharrell then beatboxed Missy's "The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)" while pounding away at an imaginary drum machine, bowing to Timbo when he was finished.The two went back and forth for a few minutes, describing each other's hits -- from "Grindin'" by the Clipse to "Big Pimpin'" by JAY-Z featuring UGK.Pharrell, King Push, Chad, and Tim also discuss growing up together, meeting Teddy, and more.</p><p>Check out the full conversation above.</p></div>
