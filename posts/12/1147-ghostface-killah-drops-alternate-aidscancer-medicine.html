  <h1>Ghostface Killah Drops Alternate AIDS/Cancer Medicine</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>The wait is over, Ghostface Killah struck back at Martin Schkreli earlier today with one of his trademark GFC video rants – the type legends are made of.</p><p>I'm actually downplaying it; he dismantled the owner of the two million dollar "Night In Shaolin" album in every way possible.</p><p>Hilarity aside, though, Ghost also added some serious karma to his aura by directly addressing Martin's controversial increasing the Daraprim pill (from $13.50 to $750.00) by introducing Wu Goo CBD Oil, alternative medicine for cancer and AIDS patients.&amp;nbsp;

According to Ghost, CBD helps with cancer, aids, blood pressure, etc.</p><p>One testimonial even boasted about the positive effects of Wu Goo CBD oil had on a patient recovering from brain surgery.</p><p>Shouts to GFC for this one – using his likeness and influence for good.</p><p>Could philanthropy be Wu 2.0?&amp;nbsp;
