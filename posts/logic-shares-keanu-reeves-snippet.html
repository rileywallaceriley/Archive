    <h1>Logic Shares "Keanu Reeves" Snippet</h1>
    <div class="meta">2019-01-15 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Logic is already having a great 2019 considering his debut novel Supermarket became a #1 new release on Amazon after the pre-order went live on January 9. But it's still all about the bars.</p>
<p>With a host of projects on deck, Bobby took to his social profiles on Tuesday (January 15) to tease a new single, "Keanu Reeves.""Keanu Reeves," he captioned the snippet. "When should I drop this?"Produced by frequent collaborator 6ix -- who executively produced YSIV -- the song and video are loaded with humor, memes and even a little self-awareness."Did you know I'm mixed like Obama," he raps, adding "It ain't a project if Logic ain't talkin' bout being bi-racial."It remains to be seen if this is a taste of Ultra 85 or another step along the way, but a tweet on January 7 suggested whatever is coming next will be Under Pressure meets Bobby Tarantino -- much to the joy of his fans.</p></div>
