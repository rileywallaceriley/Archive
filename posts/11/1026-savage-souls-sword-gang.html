  <h1>Savage Souls – Sword Gang</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Each month, we here at Above Average Hip-Hop sift through all of our submissions and choose one lucky album to review on the site.</p><p>This month I can across the Summerville, South Carolina, trio Savage Souls.</p><p>Comprised of Kae G The Original Seed, Fortune the Iron Mic Mangler and DJ Icirus, the crew reminds me of lots of people I like, so I'll try my best to sum it up properly.</p><p>They sound like a mix of Big Pun, with a side of Chris Rivers, Necro (sans the grossness), Ra The Rugged Man and Canadian group Swollen Members – all lovingly baked together into a plate of hip-hop goodness.</p><p>Their latest EP, which I listened to a few times, is <i>Sword Gang</i> – a 5-track appetizer for their forthcoming EP (more on that later).</p><p>I have to note it's self-produced by Kae G, which is a good look.</p><p>Right from the jump, it's a dope listen.</p><p>The title track establishes the flow, kicking off with a dope sample and some cuts before it just goes off.</p><p>My personal opinion, the two spitters go hardest on the tracks, <i>Colossus</i> and <i>Beyond Average</i>.</p><p>The beats are full of dope samples, and compliment the artists very well.</p><p>They've clearly found a lane that works well for them.</p><p>The main drawback from the project is that it's sonically one-dimensional.</p><p>If you like it, you'll love it.</p><p>If you're on the fence, you won't find anything here to sway you; although, I'll admit that I'm slightly ignorant to their full catalogue of work.</p><p>It would be dope to hear them try some different sound-beds out.</p><p>Overalls I like em'.</p><p>Samples, cuts and a pause-play tape feel that I can't help but have a soft spot for.</p><p>Savage Souls are dope, and definitely deserve a few spins.
