  <h1>Tae Smooth Collects His Life Experiences On His Debut LP</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Charlotte, North Carolina, rapper Tae Smooth likens himself a citizen of the world -- having traveled every continent except Antarctica.</p><p>He's also a veteran having served in Afghanistan.</p><p>His globe-trotting has peppered his work with a unique worldwide flair.</p><p>A humorous story is that he credits a trip to Thailand with the instilling in him the confidence to create music.

"A local shopkeeper asked me if I was a rap star," he says with a laugh.</p><p>Not one to shy away, Tae played along and laid down a quick 16 bars to a receptive crowd.</p><p>That's when he knew music was his calling.</p><p>His debut, <em>Smooth Way Out</em>, is an amalgamation of Tae's life thus far -- from the streets to the battlefields of Afghanistan.</p><p>The LP's message is distinct: the smooth way out of a  situation may not be the easiest one; but, it’s an effective one. "There are two ways to get your voice heard, it’s about music and politics, and I’ve always stuck by that," said Smooth. "Everything is art.</p><p>Your expressions are your art, and mine happens to be my voice."
