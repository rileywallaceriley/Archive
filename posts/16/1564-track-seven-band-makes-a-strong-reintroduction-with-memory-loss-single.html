  <h1>Track Seven Band Makes A Strong Reintroduction With "Memory Loss" Single</h1>

  <div class="content"><p>Today's game is truly a never-ending cycle of here today and gone tomorrow.</p><p>For<a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/?s=track+seven"> Track Seven Band,</a> haven't released a project since 2016's The Try And The Fail, the uphill battle it seems is reigniting the flame within casual fans who may have moved on to the next one.</p><p>It's this overarching idea that guides Cost's pen for their brand new single "Memory Loss."

There is a lot to unpack with this single.</p><p>Top-level, there is this flagrant (metaphorical) slap across the head -- as though he's screaming, "I'm still here, stupid." Below the surface, Cost takes the opportunity to reiterate his position, introduces rumor inducing storylines, and takes a look back at his past.</p><p>In the first verse, he drops mention of having traveled around the world on the dime of a figure whom he chooses to keep anonymous; as he explains, this person gave him the motivation he needed to jumpstart his career, but has since "turned faces." It's in this act -- he further notes that haters induce the same phenomenon -- that he seems to have found the strength to thrive.

The second verse begins by reiterating where he's come from -- noting that section 8 and financial aid were his life preservers in his darkest moments.</p><p>He also notes that he's still in debt (half of which he paid off with the money he made selling weed).</p><p>All this isn't done to glorify anything, but rather serve as motivation.</p><p>It also hammers home the fact that he has been there and done that, too.</p><p>Perhaps in a way, he's exuding the same motivation that he felt traveling the world.</p><p>Playing chess as opposed to checkers is a line that poignantly pops out. "Memory Loss" is a strong (re)introduction or merely business as usual -- depending on your knowledge of the band.</p><p>Either way, it's drenched in that endearing sense of honesty and realness that made them a group I've returned to numerous times since first being introduced to their music.</p><p>It's all about the long game, and -- in the end -- good music.</p><p>Cost notes that he's motivated by things that money can't buy.</p><p>That, quite often, is code for having something to lose on a deeper level.</p><p>It's in seeing an artist stick to their figurative guns without bending their ethics that true inspiration can be felt.</p><p>If you haven't explored the past releases, do so ... immediately.
