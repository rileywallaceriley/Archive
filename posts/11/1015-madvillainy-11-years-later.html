  <h1>Madvillainy: 11 Years Later</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><blockquote>"So nasty that it's probably somewhat of a travesty..."<br><br>— DOOM</blockquote><p>It's all entertainment.</p><p>When it comes to the rap game, you often need to take the character most artists portray both on stage – and on wax – with a grain of salt.</p><p>Whether most of them reveal it or not, they wear a "mask" (so to speak).</p><p>Without argument no artist plays a character better MF DOOM.</p><p>While donning his trademark tin mask, he tackles beats with no regard for your thought process.</p><p>He never breaks character, even in the streets.</p><p>Why?</p><p>DOOM himself describes it as freeing, by forcing listeners to focus on the music itself.</p><p>He tested this theory by using fake DOOMs for a string of shows as few years back.</p><p>Results were mixed, by which I means terrible.</p><p>Irregardless today marks an anniversary for the metal faced villain.</p><p>It's been exactly 11 years since the release of Madvillainy, the collaboration album between the always interesting MF <strike> Doom</strike> DOOM and brilliant producer Madlib.</p><p>The album still, and always will stand as a testament to alternative hip-hop at it's rawest.</p><p>The album, stitched together as a collection of seemingly random gems, was non-commercial, creative and packaged with one of the most haunting covers I've ever come across.</p><p>The album, in hindsight, did a few things <i>really</i> well.</p><p>Firstly, It took DOOM to another level.</p><p>His previous project <i>Mm Food</i> was dope, and had DOOM's trademark sound, but this project seemed more polished.</p><p>As seemingly random as it was, it was all orchestrated.</p><p>DOOM showed many faces – he was a pimp, a pothead, a disgruntled boyfriend, a hustler and a troubled soul.</p><p>He created a body of work that definitely requires multiple listens.</p><p>Secondly, it really solidified Madlib as the shit.</p><p>Not to say he wasn't dope before this – his work has been fire since Lootpack.</p><p>But <i>Madvillainy</i> was a whole new plane as far as I'm concerned.</p><p>From <i>Accordion</i> and <i>Money Folder </i>to <i>All Caps</i> and <i>Rhinestone Cowbo</i>y, his sound was eerie, inspiring and beautiful.</p><p>DOOM never really topped this album in my mind, and it's an album I'll probably listen to <i>and</i> love it years from now.</p><p>It stands as a milestone in the Stones Throw catalogue.</p><p>What it lacked in structure, coherence and adherence to commercial standards it more than made up for with creativity, production and sheer dopeness.</p><p>Remember, all caps when you spell the man's name!</p></div>
