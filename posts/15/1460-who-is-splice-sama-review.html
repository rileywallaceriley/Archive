  <h1>Who Is Splice Sama? [Review]</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sun, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><p style="text-align: left;">Back in his original form, Weeknd was a dark mystery wrapped in haunting falsettos.</p><p>His dark non-descript aura made for a sweet eventual reveal.</p><p>That initial run came to mind while taking in Splice Sama; however, with a slightly more complicated backstory, I’m not exactly sure how a reveal would play out.</p>
“ an inter-dimensional alien from the planet Otherworld,” he explains in his bio, “a small planet that orbits the Earth on a higher dimensional plane where love, art, and music are the catalysts for our existence.”

So, weird.</p><p>As is the proposition that he’s discovered and fallen in love with our music.</p><p>His sole mission is to share his experience through songs and the stories, straight from the heart of Los Angeles, California.</p><p>At this point, it’s really up to you whether you go with it; obviously, I played ball.</p><p>Huge win.</p><p>His latest project (which is officially an EP) <i>Dark City Vacation</i> is a brilliantly self-aware and cohesive piece of art.</p><p>Dripping in a low-maintenance trap vibe, this  showcases some serious writing chops and understanding of how to ride the same old wave his way.</p><p>Off the rip, he hits stride with “Jasmine,” and rides that pocket through the remaining five tracks; highlights here include the ‘I’m with your girl when she’s out’ narrative of “Mia” and the super smooth “Flying,” which is surprisingly focused on (among a few things) perseverance.

“Lost In Space” actually makes the perfect bookend for the project.</p><p>Overall, his production (handled by blk.MVSK) stays quite constant—you can turn it up and let it rock without any interruptions in the flow of things.</p><p>Consider it the best kind of even-keeled high.</p><p>He’s not wholly original—but he’s quality.</p><p>This can and should fit snugly into any playlist you have right now while maintaining a level of allure that keeps you on the hook.We know everything and nothing about this kid.</p><p>We’re with it!</p><p>Give him a spin, below.
