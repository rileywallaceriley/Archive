  <h1>Hodgy Drops A New Video From His Upcoming Album</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><blockquote>“I am a wizard, an illusionist.</p><p>I am a dreamer in a dream without a society.</p><p>I am Hodgy.”</blockquote>
Hodgy got his start in the game as one of the founding members of Odd Future—a groundbreaking collective that birthed the careers of Tyler The Creator, Earl Sweatshirt, Frank Ocean and Casey Veggies (amongst others).</p><p>The group has since dissolved, but Hodgy, like his  brethren is stepping out on the ledge by himself with his first official solo debut album, <i>Fireplace: TheNotTheOtherSide</i>, on Columbia.</p><p>With guest spots from Lil Wayne, Busta Rhymes and Salomon Faye to production from BadBadNotGood, Unknown Mortal Orchestra, Knxwledge, 88-Keys Nottz, Rahki, Jonti and more, the project is a diverse and eclectic introduction to a Hodgy we haven't yet met—mature and worldly.</p><p>As he describes it, “My debut album is gratefully my past to present.</p><p>Same time I had got my solo deal, around the time me and my child’s mother were at wit’s end, I was in search for a higher ground.”

But it's nothing—he's already light years past this album.</p><p>A collaborative album with Nelly Furtado in the works and he is currently putting together the pieces for another MellowHype project, all while envisioning his sophomore album.</p><p>While you wait for your pre-order, dropping December 9th, you can watch the new video/single "Barbell," which is an amazing appetizer for the main course.</p><p>Are you feeling it?</p><p>Hit us on Twitter and let us know.
