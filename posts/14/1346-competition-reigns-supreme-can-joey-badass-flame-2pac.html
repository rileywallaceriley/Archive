  <h1>Competition Reigns Supreme: Could Joey Badass Out Battle 2Pac?</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sat, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><blockquote>"Pac was (one of) the greatest voices of <i>MY</i> generation, but that doesn't make him the greatest voice of every generation ever."</blockquote>
When Tupac passed away in Las Vegas after being shot , young Brooklynite Jo-Vaughn Virginie Scott (whom I share a birthday with) was either learning to walk, making a mess, or giving his mother the business as she tried to feed him.</p><p>This—of course—is because the young rapper, known as Joey Badass, was still under two years old.</p><p>This week, he was grossly misunderstood when he proclaimed (amidst some omitted context) that he could flame Tupac Shakur in a bar for bar bout.</p><p>Old heads went in on the "Devastated" rapper, naturally; however, I think the blowback has been slightly unwarranted—here's why.</p><p>First, we need to note that this isn't an ignorance thing; unlike other younger artists like <a href="https://youtu.be/qb6YM2-cIbE">Yachty</a>, Joey knows Pac's music.</p><p>Very well, actually.</p><p>He's been on record as calling him an inspiration.</p><p>He even did so in the same interview that many didn't bother actually to watch.</p><p>As Joey explained, "they set the bar." This bar was studied, and the young rapper feels as though he's able to—on a strict bar for bar level—surpass it.</p><p>So what's wrong with that?</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>The problem is with <i>you</i>.</p><p>The next generation is destined to smash the one that precedes it.</p><p>Also, hip-hop is a competitive arena, where aiming to be better comes with the territory.</p><p>It's unfair to use the grandeur of Pac's legacy as a whole to try and discredit a youngster only five-odd years into his career—and with a wicked amount of accolades and co-signs.</p><p>Again, Joey isn't an average mumble rapper.</p><p>He's a lyricist whose done more for the underground true-school, backpack wearing, 90s-centric New York hip-hop scene than many rappers have done in a LONG time.</p><p>That's the reason that <a href="https://youtu.be/8P5dArHvHPM">major figures like Premier were so eager to work with him early on</a>.</p><p>He not imitating, he's organically building upon.</p><p>Also, to his credit, he didn't live through Pac's era—meaning he never caught the revolutionary aura of his 'alive' charisma.</p><p>But he still understands it; pretty commendable.</p><p>Listen, Pac was an amazing individual who at 25-26 changed the world .</p><p>But we're not talking about anything else except bars; could Joey flame him in a battle?</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>It's not a clear-cut win, by any means.</p><p>We'll never truly know because Pac isn't here, but we need to stop holding onto Biggie and Pac being 'the greatest artists of all time, period, end of story.' It's holding a lot of people back from experiencing some great music, and polarizing young listeners from old listeners.</p><p>Joey thinks he can flame his idols—and maybe he can.</p><p>He's not the first to claim such, and won't be the last. <a href="https://youtu.be/P-bZWMZgSN0">LL Cool J shit on Kool Moe Dee</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/z63cQKWlDgQ">Canibus shit on LL</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/41qC3w3UUkU">Pac shit on everyone</a>.</p><p>That's what hip-hop is!</p><p>Just...open your mind.</p><p>Pac was (one of) the greatest voices of <i>MY</i> generation, but that doesn't make him the greatest voice of every generation ever.</p><p>Let the new generation find their own Pac without us telling them to stop looking.</p><p>With all due respect; Pac will never be replaced—no need to rush to his defense.</p><p>His legacy is solidified.</p><p>Hip-hop is growing, grow with it.</p><p>Joey's new album is dropping within a month—support good old fashioned New York hip-hop; it still exists, just so you know!</p></div>
