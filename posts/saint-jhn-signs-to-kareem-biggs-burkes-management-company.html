    <h1>SAINt JHN Signs To Kareem "Biggs" Burke's Management Company</h1>
    <div class="meta">2019-02-20 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Roc-A-Fella Records co-founder Kareem "Biggs" Burke is making a triumphant return to Hip Hop after 13 years, signing his first new artist, SAINt JHN, to his Circle of Success Management Company.After losing his love for the music, he credits a rekindled passion with the discovery of the Brooklyn MC's critically acclaimed debut LP Collection One -- a project SAINt JHN told HipHopDX took him a lifetime to create.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Ykxh9n5Hg"You’re making the first thing you introduce to people. It takes so many different experiences and exchanges ... things that I’m talking about in this project, one way or another, they might’ve come from different times [in my life]," SAINt JHN explained back in March 2018.Burke -- who executively produced all of JAY-Z's albums up to The Black Album -- described first hearing the project in a conversation with Billboard."The night [Roc Nation co-founder Tyran Smith], played a preview of SAINt JHN's new album, I drove home listening to Collection One and had an immediate sonic connection to his music."After later crossing paths at a fashion show, the two struck up a relationship.</p>
<p>It was hearing unreleased music by the rapper that ultimately convinced Burke to partner with him."The last 2 projects I’ve done was College Dropout and Late Registration," Burke wrote on Instagram. "After such a long time away I’ve decided to jump back in with someone who I believe will be equally as impactful ... [SAINt JHN] made the decision easy for me.""It’s very rare you come across talent like his," he added. "I’m BACK!"</p></div>
