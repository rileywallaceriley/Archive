"DJ O-Zone [who has produced for the likes of Chance The Rapper and Mobb Deep] texted me ... he said he made a beat and wanted to put me in the studio with Rockie to see what comes about. [This song] was the outcome of that session."Stream the video for First Class Bee and Rockie Fresh's "New World Order" above.
