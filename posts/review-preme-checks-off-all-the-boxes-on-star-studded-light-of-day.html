    <h1>Review: Preme Checks Off All The Boxes On Star-Studded "Light Of Day"</h1>
    <div class="meta">2018-05-16 — reviews</div>
    <div class="content"><p>It's been over two years since Toronto rapper Preme (formerly known as P. Reign) dropped his last body of work, Off The Books.</p>
<p>His latest, the aptly titled Light Of Day -- his first project since changing his name -- delivers on many fronts. Sitting at 15-songs in length, including a few previously released songs, the album is a healthy balance, dripping with personality at points, while merely blending in at others.Preme's relationship with Drake has allowed him to land monster features in the past, and this project is no different.</p>
<p>A-listers like Offset, Ty Dolla $ign, YG, and Post Malone all drop by, helping pack the LP with sure shots that could all stand alone as singles. The Lil Wayne-featured “Hot Boy,” which was previously given a visual treatment, and the lead single “Can’t Hang” featuring PARTYNEXTDOOR sound great, but also align with today's norm, making them less of an attraction than they would in a less crowded climate.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwYuUsOV1wHis over-Auto-Tuned singing on the Stoney-assisted “Jackie Chan” for example, is a musical version of the Spider-Man clone meme.</p>
<p>The same could be said for his Ty Dolla $ign-seque crooning on various songs.There is a balance, though. ”Ill Life 4” continues the series with its piano-driven instrumental sees Preme catching his footing (lyrically), dropping bars that work to develop him as an individual. “From flippin' burgers to committin' burglaries ... from winnin' spelling bee's to catchin' felonies,” he raps, also adding “It's my story, if I ain't tell it, it will never be told.”“One Day” truly showcases Preme going over and above with the songwriting. The song explores two different individuals caught up in the system — and the unfavorable life circumstances that brought them to that point. “Loaded,” the funky West Coast collaboration with YG, is another standout, with Preme dropping rapid fire bars over DJ Mustard’s signature keyboard magic.Although Light Of Day doesn't go the distance to differentiate him from the many (many) others populating the same lane, if you’re a fan of Preme, P.</p>
<p>Reign or vibey contraptions, the odds you'll love Light Of Day increase tremendously.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXwzKvuM7ogIf you have yet to catch the wave, there is more than enough bangers and co-signs — see the massive DJ Khaled salute in the outro to “Frostbite” — to keep Preme buzzing all summer long.[apple_news_ad type="standard"]</p></div>
