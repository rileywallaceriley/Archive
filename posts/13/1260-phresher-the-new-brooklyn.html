  <h1>Phresher: The New Brooklyn</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Brooklyn has always been a hotbed of raw, genre-defining hip-hop talent.</p><p>From Biggie Smalls and Special Ed to Busta Rhymes and Sean Price.</p><p>Phresher is simply another chapter in a long line of royalty.</p><p>Growing up in Bamaz projects in East New York (statistically the part of Brooklyn with the highest crime rate), he was an only child raised by both his parents. "My ultimate inspiration—and the reason I am the man I am today—is because of my parents," he proudly states, they're my heroes." It was one day when his father sent him a beat that he began to explore his skills on the mic; "I was like hey this  sounds good.</p><p>From there I didn't stop."

Flash forward to today, and Phresher is on the cusp of stardom.</p><p>Currently, he's enjoying the attention that comes along with a buzzing hit-single; "Wait A Minute," which features multi-platinum selling rapper and entrepreneur, 50 Cent, appeared as a bonus cut on the DJ Whoo Kid mixtape, Lost Flash Drive that was released on G-Unit records.</p><p>The song is in rotation across the country, and —as a byproduct—he's been hitting plenty stages, including some dates opening for the G-Unit.</p><p>Pre "Wait A Minute" success he built an admirable amount of interest collaborating Desiigner for singles, before the 2016 XXL Freshman hit overnight success with the runaway hit, "Panda." The two tracks have since ballooned in their intake.</p><p>With his trajectory headed continuously upward, Phresher remains down to earth and focused on his goals.</p><p>With a long-term desire to act, a passion for fashion with his clothing line SOBarKlay, and a philanthropic spirit, he's as well-rounded as they come.</p><p>Whether it's working on his upcoming EP, <i>PH</i>, or coaching youth football, you're not apt to find the buzz-worthy artist sitting still, or engaging in activity that doesn't help to either better his community or bolster his brand.</p><p>He's an artist you don't want to sleep on for 2017.</p></div>
