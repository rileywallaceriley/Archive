  <div class="content"><p>Jordan Peele, who is rocking the black-horror film crown is bringing a reimagined version of the cult-classic Candyman to life, and according to a report by Variety, it’s set to star Yahya Abdul-Mateen II who — among other roles — played Cadillac in Netflix’s The Get Down.Most recently seen in the role of Black Manta in DC’s Aquaman, Abdul-Mateen will take on the role of the vengeful hook-wielding title-character, originally portrayed by Tony Todd in 1992.</p><p>The film is going to take place in its original Chicago location, albeit a newly gentrified setting rather than the Cabrini-Green housing projects in the original.Embed from Getty ImagesIn an interview with SYFY in December, 2018, the OG Candyman said he had mixed feelings about the reboot, but did say “Even if they make it without me, which I doubt, the attention the new movie will create will lead folks back to the original  because people like to see the source material.”https://youtu.be/rL5bohN0d-EThe film is set to release in theatres on June 12, 2020.</p><p>Abdul-Mateen is also starring in Peele’s Us, which opens in theaters this March.</p></div>
