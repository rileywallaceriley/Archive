    <h1>Migos' "APESHIT" Reference Track Reveals Role In Writing Beyoncé's Verses</h1>

    <div class="content"><p>Once JAY-Z and Beyoncé dropped their surprise album EVERYTHING IS LOVE project on TIDAL, many fans deduced that Migos were behind the adlibs on "APESHIT." The full album credits proved this to be correct, revealing both Quavo and Offset were actually credited as writers.However, it appears the Migos members were behind more than just random adlibs.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJDXGT8IFTUMemes pointing out that Queen Bey sounded like a fourth Migos member appear to have more validity than expected. A reference track that surfaced on Monday (June 18) reveals Quavo and Offset wrote her verses too.While there were some slight alterations, it's clear Bey didn't stray too far from the original vision.For example, the first from Quavo on the demo goes:She wanna go with me/ I told her to roll the weed/ She cannot be with me/ But I can put you on the team/ Ice ornaments/ Icy style tournaments/ You ain’t on to this/ Don’t think they on to thisBey's verse goes:He wanna go with me/ He like to roll the weed/ He wanna be with me/ He wanna give me that vitamin D/ Ice ornaments/ Icy style tournaments/ You ain’t on to this/ Don’t think they on to thisAlthough Beyoncé got an obvious assist from Migos, JAY's verse seems to be an original.</p>
