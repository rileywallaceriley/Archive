  <h1>#INDIESPOTLIGHT: NXUS -- Holy wATEr [Video]</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>22-year-old NXUS, who is one-third of the trio known as Dead Reputation (with Delirious Beats  and Rake ), continues to impress me.</p><p>I was a huge fan of their last collective release, "<a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/dead-rep-rake-cat/">Rake Cat</a>," and his latest record "Holy wATEr" --and grimy visual-- continues to keep me interested, with an almost Chance The Rapper cadence.</p><p>He comes off optically as a blend of Odd Future and A$AP Mobb, by that I mean, he is straight up bars, but he has just the right amount of darkness and mystery to him.</p><p>I feel like his music doesn't tell me too much about him, but it's just enough--which I understand is hard to explain.</p><p>As I mentioned the last time I wrote about him, I get the vibe from NXUS; he has something about him--you can just feel that he's headed along the right incline.</p><p>Give "Holy wATEr," and tell a friend to tell a friend.</p><p>Early</p></div>
