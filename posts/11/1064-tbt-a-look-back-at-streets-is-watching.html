  <h1>#TBT: A Look Back At Streets is Watching</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Something Meek Mill said in his "beef resignation letter" really stuck out for some reason.</p><p>Specifically, it was when he detailed how idiotic risking his money and career over some street shit would truly be.</p><p>Oddly enough, when I read the statement, the following line popped into my head: "...</p><p>If I shoot you, I'm brainless; if you shoot me, you're famous – so what's a brother to do?"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I'm a rap nerd, so instantly Ingot nostalgic and dug out my <em>Streets Is Watching</em> soundtrack.</p><p>While listening, I started thinking about what an amazingly hype project  this was, in hindsight.</p><p>I mean long before his wife dropped a mystery album with a (high quality) video for every song, Jay-Z released probably – at the time – the most ambitious project ever.</p><p>Let's hop in our time machine – beep.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The time is May 1998.</p><p>Jay-Z was revelling in the mixed success of his second album, <em><a href=" My Lifetime Vol.1</a></em>.</p><p>I say mixed because even though it was <strong>extremely</strong> successful on the charts, many claimed the album was much more polished and commercial than his debut, which was considered a classic.</p><p>Led by singles like <em><a href=" and <em><a href=" Know What Girls Like</a></em>, many lovingly regarded him as a "sell out." .</p><p>In the midst of this, Jay released the Dame Dash produced film, <em>Streets is Watching</em>: a self-funded (300k+) film.</p><p>It was a collection of unreleased videos and cinematic storylines that (roughly) told the story of how he came up and made a name for himself in the rap game. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When discussing the film, Dame describes the intense label intervention they had up to that point.</p><p>They were less than excited about the single <em><a href=" (</em>specifically, its video<em>)</em>, and seemed to share some of the same sentiments the streets did.</p><p>The mantra behind this project is that he wanted to give visual treatment to the b-sides, and tracks that the labels <em>didn't</em> want to push.</p><p>Understandably, the label didn't want to pay for it, so they paid for it themselves – out of pocket. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The cinematography, the wide angle lenses, the dialogue; it's an excellent blend of tail end golden-era bars and aesthetic, with pre jiggy-era opulence.</p><p>If you haven't watched it, it's a must-see.</p><p>Especially if you're an early Jay fan.</p><p>It brings many of his, arguably, <strong>best</strong> songs (up to that point) to life.</p><p>It was even the first place that some of us got to his first videos, <em><a href=" My Lifetime</a></em> and <em><a href=" Can't Get With That</a></em>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This project is often left out of conversations about Jigga, but it's worth recalling.</p><p>It was incredibly ambitious, and ahead of its time.</p><p>I liken it to the way that people seem never to give Naughty By Nature props for being the first rap group to drop a clothing line. <em>Streets is Watching</em>, and its soundtrack featured many upstarts.</p><p>Even the sole soundtrack appearance of the short-lived group Murda Inc (consisting of Jigga, Ja Rule and DMX), were staples in my life back in 1998.</p><p>The biggest reason it took a backseat commercially?</p><p>Well, four short months later he released <em>In My Lifetime Vol. 2</em>, which still stands as his highest selling album, going quintuple platinum. <em>Streets is Watching</em> stood no chance against <em><a href=" Knock Life</a></em>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It's never too late.</p><p>Hop in the time machine, and enjoy this #TBT gem.</span></p></p></div>
