  <h1>Will We Finally See A Jay Electronica Album In 2017?</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Hip-hop has long had a running list of holy grail albums, many of which will never see the light of day. Dr.</p><p>Dre's Detox, for example, has been playfully teased for years, with many claiming to have heard various iterations of the album.</p><p>There was also the lost original version of Method Man's debut album, or the long-lost Jay-Z diss record towards Tupac.</p><p>You can find more examples that I've run down, here.</p><p>One of the most anticipated in recent years, though, has been the long-promised  debut album from Jay Electronica; a collection of music that he jokingly teased on the "Exhibit C" when he name dropped the legends in the game blowing up his phone looking for the album.</p><p>Well, this past weekend at the TidalxNOLA NBA All-Star Weekend event, Jay-Z uttered something the drove fans insane, “put the album out."

This carrot has been dangled in front of us before over the years—most recently in July when fans were told to look for it in 40 days.</p><p>The question is, though, will it truly live up to the hype?</p><p>Although fans seem to have moved on from Jay's movement, it's occurrences like this that remind us how geeked we are to one day take in the fabled project.
