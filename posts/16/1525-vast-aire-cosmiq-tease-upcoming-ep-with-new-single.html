In an interview earlier this year, Vast and COSMIQ told AAHH about the upcoming EP. “I would look at it as <em>Live From The Aireport FreEP</em> is just a series of dope new records from  IGC, and all the people connected to IGC,” COSMIQ said. “Just giving fans a window into what we’ve been working on.”

Vast added “The EP is on a similar wavelength , but it’s not all COSMIQ ...  will be on it, and he’ll be helping to guide it, but it’s not gonna be all him.</p><p>I’m gonna have guest producers, and there’s gonna be more interaction with different MCs.”

The duo promise the impending album, <em>Aireplane</em>, will be cinematic in nature, with multiple layers of complex rhyming sure to make real heads — and longtime fans — swoon.</p><p>That is set to dro this winter (though no exact date is confirmed).</p><p>For now, we can look forward to <em>Live From The Aireport FreEP</em> this Thanksgiving.
