    <h1>Buffalo Artist Jae Skeese Releases “Subjective Humility” LP & Animated Video</h1>
    <div class="meta">2019-01-23 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>After a self-imposed hiatus following the release of his 2016 LP 13, Buffalo MC — and Griselda affiliate — Jae Skeese is making a return to the game with a brand new album Subjective Humility, produced entirely by longtime collaborator Mitch Arizona.Poised to be his breakout moment, he insists his motivations for coming back to the game are bigger than industry BS.“The biggest reason for coming with a project after such a long time is really just because I gained a lot of experience through living,” Jae tells HipHopDX, as he describes the immense life changes he’s experienced over the past few years.“I lost some people in terms of family. I had my daughter ... I gained family,” he explains. “I went through some of the roughest times and, as cliche as that sounds, it really puts a lot of things in perspective.”https://youtube.com/watch?v=a-6YDobXiZ4He describes the album as being meant to offer up a positive experience, without losing any of the grit. “I know there's a lot of other people out there who may not be in the best situation that they've ever been in,” he notes, pointing out that his music was patterned to help others through.</p>
<p>Skeese also breaks down why his latest single and animated visual from the LP, “Word To Mommy” — which you can stream above — is so important to him. “It just speaks on flaky people, you know. The type of people who like to have things just to have them, or just want relationships to have relationships ... but are quick to dump those for other things or relationships,” he says, noting it’s an energy he is trying to keep out of his circle for 2019.Jae was formerly in a group alongside producer Camoflaug Monk — who has numerous credits on Westside Gunn’s Hitler Wears Hermes 1-3 and Flygod — Billie Essco (who is another WSG collaborator), and Mitch Arizona.</p>
<p>They are/were (more than anything) a family situation, which is a strong parallel to the current triple-threat Griselda roster. Subjective Humility is his seventh solo-release.</p>
<p>The 10-song project, featuring Miles B., Naas Kimiko, Kay Makavel, and Mickey Factz, can be streamed below.https://open.spotify.com/album/1v9OTNyxC3xz3QqyGQXiuF?si=bgHAZfjxRRyim9hlauKjEQ[apple_news_ad type="standard"]</p></div>
