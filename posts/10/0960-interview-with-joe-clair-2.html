<strong>How did you get involved with BET?</strong>

I had just graduated from college, and I felt like there was space for an educated, sort of collegiate voice in hip-hop, and I thought that I could be him.</p><p>I was living in DC at the time – the BET headquarters wasn't not too far from where I lived, so I picked up the phone, called 411, got the number and started calling these guys on a regular basis.</p><p>I was leaving messages for the producer on his answering machine.</p><p>I called this guy for about, maybe ten months to a year – I can't remember correctly – but it was about that long.</p><p>In the interim, one of the associate producers saw me perform, and a month later after he saw me perform, a friend of mine was going to DJ on 'Rap City', but they didn't have a place to shoot – so I asked them, " Why don't you come to my house and shoot?" The next day, 'Rap City' came to my house.

<strong> -- That's an amazing story
</strong>
Yeah man, that's how I felt.</p><p>You could imagine it happening to you.</p><p>That's how I felt.</p><p>When they showed up the associate producer was like, "man, what's your name?" I told him "Joe Clair." He asked, "you're a comedian, right?" I was like "yeah." He said he saw me open for Paul Mooney and thought I was hilarious.</p><p>He said maybe we could do some things together.</p><p>A couple of minutes later, in walks the guy I was looking for – who I'd been calling – and the rest is history, so to speak.

<strong>What were some of your best memories of being on 'Rap City’? </strong>

Best memories – man it's hard to pinpoint.</p><p>Imagine being in your twenties, and single, and a comedian.</p><p>So I'm touring and I'm doing all the comedy stuff, and I 'm on television five days a week, interviewing rappers.</p><p>I want to say the whole thing was my best memory of 'Rap City', you know what I mean?</p><p>But some of the outstanding moments would be...the realization that I got one of the final interviews that Biggie gave or that I was sitting and smoking a blunt with Tupac while he played the Makavelli album before it came out.

<em>In the audio clip below Joe shared with another memory – meeting Rakim for the first time at the <a href="http://hiphopmagazinearchive.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/xxl-7.jpg"><em>Greatest Day In Hip-Hop History</em></a> cover shoot.</em>

<blockquote><strong>Smoking a blunt with Biggie – days before he died – was mind-blowing</strong></blockquote>
<strong>'Rap City' literally went from being in the streets, to becoming a more structured, "polished" production.</p><p>What's your take on the evolution it took?</strong>

At that time, it took on the eventual life that we had been dreading from the start and that's when the powers that be, that didn't have a real foot in the culture, got their hands on it.</p><p>It was going to be exploited, and – not to say that I'm mad at that – I wasn't looking forward to that if it meant the playing down of some of the <em>authenticity</em>, some of the <em>intelligence</em>, some of the stuff that <em>actually</em> made it a culture.</p><p>Playing down of the other aspects of hip hop that didn't generate money so much, but made it what hip hop was.</p><p>They forgot about breakdancing, and they forgot about graffiti – they forgot about <em>all</em> that.</p><p>We live in a capitalistic society so of course I suppose this had to happen but at the expense of what?</p><p>Well, now we can look back and see what the expense was.

<strong>Tell me about your album<em> <a href="http://www.datpiff.com/Joe-Clair-20-Years-Too-Late-mixtape.446900.html">20 Years Too Late</a></em>.</strong>

I've done a lot of things since 'Rap City', man.</p><p>You just keep going; you know what I mean?</p><p>I got into entertainment as a comedian, and I got into <em>media</em> through my love of hip hop.</p><p>But from that, I've got a complete knowledge of how the entertainment industry operates – what works, what doesn't work and a lot of life lessons along the way.</p><p>The album that you just talked about, or the mixtape as I like to call it, was a culmination of where I had been, and I thought that now was the time for a voice that didn't sound like all of the other voices.</p><p>I feel like that project was a precursor to something bigger for me.</p><p>I don’t know exactly what that 'bigger' is yet.</p><p>You know in life things play themselves out all the time, so look forward to hearing my voice in some way real soon.</p><p>And either with a bigger message or with more wattage, so to speak, you know what I mean?
