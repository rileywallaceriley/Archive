  <div class="content"><p>C Wells might not have tracks on your phone yet, but he’s trying to reserve some space in the future.</p><p>This young emcee reps Lynn, MA an area just outside of Boston; it's nicknamed the “City of Sin,” and the fact that Boston gangster films Black Mass and The Departed were both shot there, should give you an idea of the burg.</p><p>Wells is set to be the star that sheds light on this vice city’s burgeoning hip-hop scene.</p><p>C Wells, dropped an 8-track mixtape of freestyles entitled <em>Dear, Summer</em> in July 2016, on which he murked the season’s biggest beats and got listeners anticipating his imminently approaching album <em>Before The Tour Bus</em>.</p><p>This upcoming effort illustrates the grind that goes into a successful career; before stardom’s inevitable arrival.</p><p>Not to mention, it is hosted by Mr.</p><p>Co-Sign himself, Don Cannon.</p><p>Before The Tour Bus includes features from G Herbo &amp; Dave East and production from C-Sick.

“It was about the middle of February, and I’m about half way thru the project at this time, and I was sitting on a song I knew had the potential to be a hit” C Wells commented to Mass Appeal. “I had already finished one verse, but I needed one more .</p><p>My partner Chy told me he wanted to make a record with East and me happen and this was the perfect track.</p><p>Of course, I was down with it, but coming from where I’m from, things like that usually don’t pull through; but Chy reached out, and Dave was down.</p><p>I got Dave’s verse and ‘Off The Porch’ was born!”
