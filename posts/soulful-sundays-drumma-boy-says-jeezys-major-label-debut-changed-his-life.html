    <h1>Soulful Sundays: Drumma Boy Says Jeezy's Major Label Debut Changed His Life</h1>
    <div class="meta">2018-09-02 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>In the latest installment of Soulful Sundays, HipHopDX’s Editor-In-Chief Trent Clark chats with super producer Drumma Boy at Comfort LA in downtown Los Angeles.Having worked with a staggering list of artists that includes some of the biggest acts to come out of the south, Drumma has a lot to discuss. The 35-year-old producer talks about the first beats ever sold, the importance of Young Jeezy's solo debut and cryptocurrency."The first beats I sold professionally was to Yo Gotti for his Life album," he recalls, noting that he produced four tracks on the LP. "From there I did some stuff with J.</p>
<p>Prince at Rap-A-Lot ... he paid me like $2,500 for three tracks on Tela's Double Dose album."Ultimately, he credits "Standing Ovation" from Jeezy's major label debut Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101 as the turning point for his career."That was my first platinum plaque," he says. "It allowed me to get on my feet and get my first publishing deal. It allowed me to establish my first home and build my first studio."https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiGnc8l4psAdditionally, the record afforded him the ability to move to a central location in Atlanta."I was spending $850 to $900 just on gas a month," he notes. "That's another rent."Drumma also shares some insight into his investment in XYO Network, a cryptocurrency brand."Once you get to making real money, you want to invest it in different ways," he explains. "Once you become a brand, you want to create situations where you don't have to invest your own money, which is more important."Earlier this month, he dropped a DJ XO-assisted single in promotion of the coin that he says is already named one of the top coins."Dan Bilzerian is over there now, even the Bitcoin Foundation Founder [Charlie Shrem] just came over and joined," he notes. "They are also the first cryptocurrency company to sponsor NASCAR racers, which is huge.</p>
<p>It's just crazy to be a part of this."https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDgEfndwt5kOne of the biggest takeaways from the conversation -- especially for producers -- is the description of how he sells his production to artists using a five-beat pitch."I'm doing homework ... I'm watching YouTube, and I'm seeing how they perform," he says. "I'm watching their shows and listening to their album so I can be prepared on what to play for them. I play five beats."I played two beats for Kevin Gates, and he just said, 'Don't play no more, let me go ahead and' .... you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Because I did my homework. I did my research, so I'm more effective than just, 'Let me let you hear what I'm doing' and then just showcasing me."It's not about me.</p>
<p>It's about servicing you. That's what delivers the job.</p>
<p>That's what delivers the multi-millions."Check out the full interview with Drumma Boy above.[apple_news_ad type="any"]</p></div>
