Like I've said in the past, I'm big on championing up and coming acts here on AAHIPHOP, because – hey – that's the whole reason we started the site in the first place.</p><p>A month or two back, I reviewed the debut mixtape by a young windy-city rapper by the name of <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/tooty-first-degree-murder/">Toot</a>y .</p><p>I was majorly impressed by <i><a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/tooty-first-degree-murder/">First Degree Murder</a></i>, and have been anticipating the release of his upcoming EP, <i>Suicidal Thoughts</i>, which drops November 24th.</p><p>To bridge the gap, and keep the heads appeased in the meanwhile, Tootie recently dropped visuals for the EP's first single, <em>Stepping Stone</em>.</p><p>Produced by Von Vuai, the track is introspective, and sees Tootie walking through some of the circumstances in his environment leading to the manifestation of suicidal thoughts.</p><p>It also has an astute message of perseverance: "<i>Can't score if you don't shoot, I don't mind missing, because all my niggas gone rebound and grind with me</i>".</p><p>He's showing tremendous growth already as an artist, and we're excited to take in his full 7-song project – produced entirely by Von Vuai – when it drops.</p></div>
