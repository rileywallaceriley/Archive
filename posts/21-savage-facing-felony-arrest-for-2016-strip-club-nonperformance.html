    <h1>21 Savage Facing Felony Arrest For 2016 Strip Club Nonperformance</h1>
    <div class="meta">2019-02-15 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>It's been a rough February for UK-born rapper 21 Savage. After being released from ICE custody, posting a $100,000 bond on Wednesday (February 13), he is now dealing with a felony warrant for failing to deliver on a strip club performance in 2016 -- despite pulling up to the venue and being paid $17,000.According to a TMZ report, the promoter he allegedly stiffed filed a police report and the paperwork necessary for a felony warrant for theft by deception.</p>
<p>The warrant sat idle for two years until the promoter finally decided to pursue the criminal case following 21's February 3 arrest.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPR9yBHCMn4For 21 -- who turned himself in Friday (February 15) to the Liberty County Sheriff's Department -- the timing couldn't be worse, as an open felony charge isn't something you want in preparation for a deportation hearing.Abby Taylor, 21's lawyer, told TMZ, "We look forward to an amicable resolution between the parties in the near future with no criminal implications whatsoever."The rap star also broke his silence on Friday (February 15) for the first time since his arrest in a high profile interview with Good Morning America.[apple_news_ad type="standard”]</p></div>
