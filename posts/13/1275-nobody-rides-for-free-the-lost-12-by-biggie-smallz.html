  <h1>Nobody Rides For Free: The Lost 12" by Biggie Smallz</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>As a preface, I've seen a few writers cover this topic over the years, but the sheer amount of blank stares the conversation elicits on my part suggests that revisiting it wouldn't be such bad idea.</p><p>I've made it no secret in the past that I'm a vinyl head.</p><p>I spent many a sunny afternoon in my rip-roaring 20s digging for vinyl at my local record spots.</p><p>One day, while digging in a leaky store basement through some bargain bins I came across a 12" called "Nobody Rides For Free," by Biggie Smallz.</p><p>The Z--for whatever reason-- didn't seem weird.</p><p>Being that it was from some no name record label, I assumed I'd stumbled upon some gold.</p><p>I headed back to the lab, naturally excited, only to pop it on and realize this was not--in fact--the portly rapper better known as the Notorious B.I.G, but a relatively unknown white rapper from LA who shared the same name.</p><p>My first question was, how can this be?</p><p>Well, apparently, he is one of three Biggies that exist.</p><p>This one guy was, unbelievably, connected to the late-great prolific rap icon Tupac Shakur.</p><p>The artist was working with Pac's go-to producer Johnny J--who had produced well over 100 tracks with Pac.</p><p>Johnny saw Biggie was starting to blow up, so he asked Pac if--as a favor to him--he could ask Biggie to change his name to help avoid market confusion.</p><p>Unbelievably, Puff let that happen.</p><p>Well, Biggie Smallz had only really released three records before he was tragically murdered in 1994 outside of a liquor store; however, there aren't many--or rather, any--details outside of these records about his backstory, which makes him quite mysterious.</p><p>Unfortunately all his seemingly closest associates are all dead.</p><p>As I mentioned, there was also ANOTHER Biggie Smalls, who also went by Big Dirk.</p><p>Dirk was a member of the Live Squad, who Pac also linked with; Big Stretch was also part of this crew.</p><p>Unfortunately, Dirk passed away before him and Pac could collaborate, but his death helped to spark one of the most cited pieces of audio proof that Pac's death was seemingly faked -- notably, the intro where Pac says "rest in peace to my motherfucking nigga Biggie Smalls." It's been noted Shock G and a few others in Pac's circle that this was, in fact, a salute to Dirk.</p><p>Well, this rabbit hole of hip-hop knowledge is ultimately brought to you by Biggie Smallz, so I'll leave a few of his records below.</p><p>Random, amazing.</p><p>RIP Johnny J, Pac, Dirk, and Biggie Smallz.</p><p>Keep Digging.</p></div>
