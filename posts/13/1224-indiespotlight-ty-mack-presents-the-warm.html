  <h1>#IndieSpotlight: Ty Mack Presents The Warm</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>A new album came across my desk today — all the way from Bridgeport Connecticut.</p><p>Member of the DertGang, which is an affiliated off-shoot of Dirtbag Clothing , Ty Mack delivers The Warm, a twelve-song slice of Bridgeport funk.</p><p>The project is funky melting pot of bars, and thick hazy bass; it’s a long drive through the sticks in a Cadillac with the windows down, while puffing the stickiest dank.</p><p>Production wise, the album has three distinct lanes: contemporary trapping, southside pimping, and jazzy hip-hop.</p><p>The BPM stays low and lazy, so the vibe is consistent, never jarring.</p><p>Off the top, on the almost Mad-Lib-esque first track, "Brazilians &amp; Millions," Ty sets the tone for the project, with bully bars like “You all hype; I don’t feel that — homie this is real rap.” In all honesty, the song I felt the least affinity towards was “Sally,” which is a bass canon that doesn’t seem to have the same character that the other joints have.</p><p>He gets on his 90s hip-hop shit on tracks like the sax-driven "Smoke Break (Roll Up),” and the East Coast sounding T.H.L ; and songs like “S.T.R.T,” and acronym for "Something To Ride To,” and "No Crumbs” almost put me in the mind of the 1996 Luniz album <em>Operation Stackola</em>.</p><p>This is music to ride to -- and a perfect addition to any of your summer movements.</p><p>It was my introduction to Ty Mack, who is a little bit closed off as an artist .</p><p>All of his accounts are private.</p><p>That only adds to his mystique, though.</p><p>The Warm initially dropped a year ago, so I'm a little late to the party, but he's just earned a spot on the AAHH watch.</p><p>We heard a rumor he has some new heat coming soon.</p><p>Bonus points, he has a chopped and screwed version of the album, for when you get extra lit.</p><p>Early.
