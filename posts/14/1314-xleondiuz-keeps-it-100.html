  <div class="meta">Fri, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Xleondiuz is a Florida-based up and comer we've been following for a minute now--and he's starting the New Year with a bang.</p><p>With his new record "100," he's incorporated a Drizzy "Started From The Bottom" vibe --but with  more edge to it.</p><p>It's an ode to his authenticity and further insight into his reality growing up in the streets of Dade County, one of the top 20 most dangerous cities in America.</p><p>It's a great follow-up to "Front Door," which we shared here back in early December.</p><p>The record is yet another appetizer to his mixtape Sin Paradise, which he's hoping to drop on us this February.</p><p>He also has a new visual for his record "Dade County," which is dropping soon--another record we dropped on you last month.</p><p>Check out "100," and if you're feeling it as much as we are double-tap that share button!
