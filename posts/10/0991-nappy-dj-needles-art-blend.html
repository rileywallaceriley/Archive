<strong>Introduce yourself.</strong>

I'm Nappy DJ Needles from St.</p><p>Louis.

<strong>How did you get into DJing?</strong>

I was asked by my brother to do a birthday party for one of his friends back in 1994.</p><p>All I had was tapes and a few cds to play out of a boombox but I made it work.</p><p>The response I got from playing my personal selections was infectious so I kept at it.</p><p>During that time I was always shook that some kid was gonna call me out for not being a "real" dj since I was only working with tapes, so before that ever happend, after a few years, I got a cheap mixer and mis-matched turntables and learned to mix records.</p><p>In 1998, I deejayed live with vinyl for the first time and it's been on ever since.

<strong>Who were some of your influences?</strong>

My influences include Jazzy Jeff, Rich Medina, G-Wiz, DJ Alejan and Kid Capri.

<strong>Vinyl or Serato?</strong>

Both, but I'm a digger so vinyl will always trump Serato.

<strong>What is your fave albums in your collection?</strong>

I have so many favorites I wouldn't know where to begin!

<strong>What tracks are you currently playing?</strong>

Kaytranada feat.</p><p>Vic Mensa <em>Drive Me Crazy</em>, BJ The Chicago Kid feat.</p><p>ScHoolBoy Q <em>It's True</em>, Meek Mill <em>Ice Cream Freestyle</em>, Joey Bada$$ <em>No 99</em>.

<strong>How do you approach a mash-up?</strong>

It's a pretty simple process to me.</p><p>Most times the idea to mix an acapella over a particular beat will come as I'm deejayin live.</p><p>I'll have the track going first then I'll grab the acapella and try it out in the cue.</p><p>If everything pans out, I'll run it right then.</p><p>If it hits me a certain way, that's when I decide whether or not to formerly make an official blend out of it in the lab.

<strong>Can you tell us about your projects?</strong>

I've been doing mixtapes (real mixtapes) since 1998.</p><p>From Undreground Hip-Hop to indie soul, I was putting them out constantly.</p><p>I started doing the blend projects in 2008.</p><p>The first one was entitled <em>American Gangstarr</em> where I put Jay Z's <em>American Gangster</em> lyrics over beats by Gang Starr.</p><p>In 2012, I put out <em>Blends</em> featuring mix-ups of Whitney Houston and Thundercat, Mary Mary and Run-DMC, The Beastie Boys and Tyler, The Creator, Adele and Mr.</p><p>Cheeks, etc.</p><p>The last 2 I did were <em>A Tribe Called Kast</em> (Outkast over ATCQ) in 2013 and <em>The Notorious Exchange</em> (B.I.G. over The Foreign Exchange) in 2014.
