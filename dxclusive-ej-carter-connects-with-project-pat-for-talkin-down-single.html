    <div class="meta">2019-09-20 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Following a huge summer that included a collaborative LP with his mentor Lil Flip (H Town to Pi Town) and a tour with the Houston legend, EJ Carter is back with a new Project Pat featured single, “Talkin’ Down.”"I'm fortunate to be able to work with the legend,” Carter tells HipHopDX of Project Pat — who is joining Juicy J, DJ Paul (and more) for the Three 6 Mafia reunion tour next month. “He rocked with everything I had going on and blessed the track for me.“Also gave some tidbits of advice to help me along the way. Much respect to the OG,” he adds.A one-time HipHopDX Litness Test winner, Carter first connected with Flip following the release of his sophomore project.</p>
<p>The former DJ Screw affiliate told DX during an interview this past summer that he immediately felt a connection with Carter’s music.“My first impression was that his music was jammin,” he noted. “The song ‘Propane’ was sent to me by someone in my circle about a year ago, and I immediately felt like the world needed to hear it … the world needed to hear him.”EJ Carter’s new album Birth of the Pi God is coming soon. For now, stream “Talkin’ Down” featuring Project Pat below.https://open.spotify.com/track/0GHZdZmvWPabxXdUrk2ulc?si=vPiEs2hrSTi53ebREp0nuQ[apple_news_ad type="standard”]</p></div>
