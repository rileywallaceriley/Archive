<p class="p1">Jim and Cam definitely had bars for days – although Juelz came up a <em>bit</em> light.</p><p>In his defence he didn't have headphones for some inexplicable reason (WTF?).</p><p>Anyways, it's great to see them back together – it kind of made us feel like we were back in 2002 – 2003 (in a good way).</p></p></div>
