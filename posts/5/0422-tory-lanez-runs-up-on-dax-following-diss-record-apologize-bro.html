As Tory presses him, eventually Dax says, “Sorry G.”Prior to the confrontation, Dax made a clear statement about diss tracks.</p><p>Dax wrote, “RAP IS A SPORT.</p><p>NOTHING PERSONAL," on Tuesday (February 5) following Tory’s threats that a diss record wouldn’t end with bars.This may be a case of underestimation but apologizing for a diss is something Tory has firsthand experience with doing.</p><p>The outspoken artist previously apologized to Royce Da 5'9 for starting a social media beef in December.</p><p>Speaking of Royce, the former Slaughterhouse MC took a playful jab at Tory on his new song “Field Negro,” which also dropped on Friday.</p><p>Tory hasn't responded to it as of Sunday (February 10).</p></div>
