– Siimba Liives Long</blockquote>

The "it" factor is undeniable, unavoidable and can't be fabricated.</p><p>No matter how much money you dump into an artist, if they aren't unique enough to truly stand out, then they'll have a rough time building a loyal fanbase.</p><p>A relative newcomer on the scene, Siimba Liives Long, is one such with an undeniable "it" factor.</p><p>An Ethiopian-American artist who was born in NY resided in Brooklyn and grew up in Addis (Ethiopia's capital) is about to take off – and for so many reasons.</p><p>Here's three.</p><p>First off, he's talented as hell.</p><p>He has bars, and judging what I've heard from him this far, he seems to be along the vein of golden era inspired reality rap that artists like Joey Bada$$ inhabit; however, he has a unique sound.</p><p>Second, he has a dope sense of style.</p><p>Draped in traditional garb, and with a demeanour that almost puts me in the mind of late 90's Afu-Ra, he stands out.</p><p>Lastly, his first single/video <em>Cocaine Bimbie</em> off his upcoming sonic-series <em>Zemenay's Gemiinii</em> is flames.</p><p>Even the fact that he calls it a sonic series is cool!</p><p>The video itself deserves all the attention I already know it's going to get.</p><p>It premiered yesterday on Noisy and is a must-watch.</p><p>I mean homie is walking around with lions and eating fire – it's hypnotizing.</p><p>This isn't a "rent lions and ball out in a Lear jet" kind of video either.</p><p>He's in straight up Africa, with lions!</p><p>He shot the video in Ethiopia, South Africa and Brooklyn because they all play(ed) such a big role in his life and his journey.</p><p>Also, again, keep in mind that he's an unsigned artist – so no fancy label budgets here.</p><p>He still managed to make one of the dopest visuals we've seen all year.</p><p>Just saying, though.</p><p>Siimba Liives Long is an artist to keep on your radar.</p><p>Just remember where you heard it first.
