  <h1>03 Greedo Says New LP Promotes L.A. Unity: “That’s Really Powerful For The City”</h1>

  <div class="content"><p>Following the release of a 20-minute documentary with Noisy titled Project Genius: The Story of 03 Greedo, incarcerated Watts rapper 03 Greedo finally dropped Still Summer In The Projects, executively produced by DJ Mustard.</p><p>The project is the first by the rapper since beginning his 20 year prison sentence last summer.Propelled by the buzzing second single, “Trap House” featuring Shoreline Mafia, it’s clear Greedo isn’t letting his current situation slow his ascent in any way.https://youtu.be/JlE3BpBMIz4”It’s good ,” Greedo tells HipHopDX from a Texas prison about the response the new LP has gotten. “The Shoreline Song (“Trap House”) is one of the fastest growing songs of my career.“I hear they playing it in my project,” he adds. “I ain’t gonna lie when they play my shit in my projects that’s how I know it’s fire.</p><p>Feels good.”Originally slated to drop April 5, it was one of the many albums pushed back in the shadow of Nipsey Hussle‘s March 31 murder, an event so significant it prompted a truce — and unity meeting — between Bloods and Crips.This message of unity is one that Greedo hopes people take away from the album. “ something that represents L.A. more so than any other project I’ve dropped,” he says.“We are connecting the East/West side and that’s really powerful for the city - especially right now.”Greedo was sentenced to 20 years behind bars in 2018 after pleading guilty to 2016 charges of drug trafficking and unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon.</p><p>The charges carried a potential life sentence.According to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice's website, Greedo is scheduled to become eligible for parole on September 19, 2020. https://youtu.be/_f2O9hvPIqI</p></div>
