  <h1>Mr. P Chill’s Latest LP Is A Toast To His Journey, A Call To Action & A Signal OF Continued Dedication To Hip Hop</h1>

<p>There is a level of everyday humanity often absent from Hip Hop music; that's understandable, especially if you've been following the twist, turns, and dysmorphic transformations the culture has taken.</p><p>Once big industry moved in, things got glitzy.</p><p>There are plenty of artists who happen to share a connection to the old-world order.</p><p>One who I've taken in quite consistently when approached by him is Mr.</p><p>P Chill — a Sacramento native whose been on the grind since the 80s.</p><p>Now in his 40s (46 to be exact, as he reveals in a vat on his new LP), his music continues to grow and reflect his life as it is; that is the backbone of the charm dripping from his recently released <em>L.I.F.E. - Living In Fragile Environments</em>, the follow-up to 2018's <em>Funky Uncle Chill</em>.</p>

<p>His 11-song, fourteenth release (consisting of new and already released material) teeters on a brink; he sounds understandably worn out  from what's been a 28-year roller coaster while remaining sonically dedicated and endearingly energized in attempting to find his talk through the challenges of finding his space within the sphere of Hip Hop culture. </p>

<p>The years spent on his craft are weaved throughout the set, "This Circus," for example.</p><p>But his journey is only a part of this album's narrative; there is resilience and conviction in the face of the current climate — like contemplating the connection between the murky uncertainty of the American health system and his mortality on the unexpectedly deep "Morning Coffee." He also shares commentary on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and initial 2020 lockdowns on "Social Distancing."</p>

<p>Still, the project hits its stride at its political fare, and its line posse cut Subliminal — featuring J.Smo, AlphiyOda1, and Mike Colossal. "Millions of Militants" is an audible pledge of solidarity with the Black Lives Movement and a call to take up arms in the ever-raging war against injustice.</p><p>The clever layering of the Chuck D sample creates an almost hypnotic effect on the beat.</p>

<p>Speaking of the beats, Mr.</p><p>P Chill is excellent on the boards; taking the song "Diggin' (Crate Digger's Anthem)" at face value, you can almost picture him assembling the loops that became the project's soundscape.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Many reflective themes on the LP may go over the head tops of youthful listeners; there is something so necessary about his perspective.</p><p>The project caps off with "Reflections." It's a look at where he's from, a show of appreciation for those who've helped him, and a sign his tank is far from empty. "28 years so far, and I've got another 28 years in me at least," he notes as the album wraps.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Age doesn't count in the booth — and the music feels better when it comes from the heart.</p><p>L.I.F.E. indirectly anneals itself to both points.</p><p>As long as the love remains intact, and the world continues to precariously wade in perpetual volatility, it's unlikely his pen will stop moving anytime soon.</p>
