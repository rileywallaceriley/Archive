– E.S.G, Rapper</blockquote>

On the intro to DJ Screw's <em>3 In Da Morning Part Two</em>, rapper E.S.G warned that you should never – under any circumstance – take your eyes off your screw.</p><p>The significance of that statement was rooted in a time that has long been forgotten in the sea of mainstream hip-hop and immediate media accessibility.</p><p>It also leads us to the origins of a young DJ Screw, and the grassroots nature of 90's hip-hop that ingrained itself into our hearts.</p><p>Simply put, it's why we treasure the era so much.</p><p>In the early days of Screw, around the time that his signatures slowed down and chopped up style was taking over the Houston streets, he made a hefty living making personalized tapes.</p><p>It may be hard for a 90's born millennial to imagine the world where you couldn't just burn a compact disc, but if you wanted to have the newest and/or rarest new music, and you wanted t to have that Screw stank on it, you had to go to the man himself.</p><p>Unfortunately – he's was one man.</p><p>And as you may remember, dubbing a tape is an extremely manual process.</p><p>So, to create order, clients were asked to pony up the cash, and provide a list with your contact and requests/shout outs, etc.</p><p>That list found its way into a shoebox, and then you had to wait until Screw got around to it.</p><p>Hopefully, that makes the "watch your screw" sentiment a bit more contextual for you.</p><p>Of course, today these tapes are priceless to their owners.</p><p>Have you ever had to search for music.</p><p>I'm talking manual search.</p><p>Vinyl heads and 90's collectors will agree that the experience of opening a package, and popping in a new album/single while taking in the packing and album credits is an unparalleled experience.</p><p>It’s an experience that’s been all but lost at the hands of MP3s and the immediacy of digital media in today’s landscape.</p><p>The glimmer of resurgence is beginning to take hold as a new generation become infatuated with owning any and everything on vinyl, and visionaries like RZA, and Boombotix, who are working to bring a sense of tangibility back to the music industry.</p><p>This week, as we celebrate the anniversary of DJ Screw’s passing, we should remember his influence and  his carefree innovation that’s been loosely imitated by countless DJs – and artists – in popular culture.</p><p>He’s a  symbol of originality that is sorely lacking in the game – and, as well, a sad reminder that overindulgence in illicit substances can be fatal.</p><p>Let’s all give a salute to the father of New “Screwston”, and the capo of the infamous Screwed Up Click.</p><p>Watch Yo Screw!</p></div>
