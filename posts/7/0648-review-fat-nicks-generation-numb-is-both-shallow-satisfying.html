  <h1>Review: Fat Nick's "Generation Numb" Is Both Shallow & Satisfying</h1>
  <div class="meta">2018-06-15 — reviews</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Miami rapper Fat Nick has been bubbling out of control for the past few years.</p><p>Part of the cohort of South Florida artists that includes Ski Mask The Slump God, Wifisfuneral, and others, he’s been doing insane numbers on YouTube, and touring the world, all without many mainstream looks.</p><p>His latest effort though, Generation Numb, could be the project that changes all of that.As the follow up to his 2016 LP When The Lean Runs Out, the 11-song project, is above everything, a fun listen.</p><p>It doesn’t delve any deeper than the surface — and that's precisely the point.</p><p>Rarely leaving the comfort zone of the gun, lean, and sex talk — very infrequently — the LP is a look into the psyche of a young high school drop out dripping in W sauce.</p><p>Ultimately, this is a celebratory affair.At face value, songs like “Wylin” (where he flexes on older listeners stating ”Got your whole mortgage on my diamond necklace,”) and “All The Smoke,” with a sound-bed reminiscent of Usher’s “Love In This Club,” and “Slow It Down” featuring Bexey give the album accessible commercial edge, and undeniable hit potential. not even mentioning the Blackbear-featured “Iced Out” and album closer “WTF” which have both received wacky visual treatments leading up to the LP, garnering millions of hits along the way.</p><p>They are also a must watch for unfamiliar listeners, as they help to illustrate what may be the most endearing element of this project.The enigma with Fat Nick lies in his overall presentation and personality as an artist.</p><p>He flexes his guns online, and sips lean “until he nods off,” but simultaneously has a friendly — overly humbled — personality in interviews.</p><p>However, this personality rarely shines through his music, which feels like a missed opportunity.</p><p>For example, he’s been quite vocal in conversations with publications about battling depression, and some moments, like “BFF,” work to paint his happy-go-lucky love of killer drank as more of a hopeless crutch.</p><p>But these moments are fleeting.</p><p>No matter how good they sound, song after song of the same thing doesn’t beg for multiple listens outside of a party setting.While he may not rise above the class, with repetitive music that lacks any creativity or personality, he’s not failing either.</p><p>No matter how much haters may want this project to suck, it doesn’t — but it doesn’t go out of its way to impress anyone, either. meant to be held against some of the state's more lyrical projects and artists, Generation Numb is a decent offering meant for the new breed of listener; the ones who want to turn-up without judgement.</p></div>
