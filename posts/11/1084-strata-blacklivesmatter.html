It's time to take a powerful stand, and hopefully end the slaughter of American people.

– Strata</blockquote>
&amp;nbsp;Nothing speaks louder than experience.</p><p>In 2012, Strata was almost killed after being shot in the back by a Tempe Police Officer while running away with a cell phone in his hand.</p><p>They arrested him, and he fought his case in Maricopa County Jail for three years before finally being given the chance to bond out on 275k.</p><p>Now, with a second chance at life, he's developed his music into his unique sound.</p><p>He feels this is the best way to speak out against this epidemic and honor those who weren't as lucky as him.</p><p>His haunting and powerful new single/video, #<i>BlackLivesMatter</i>, is his chance to say non-violently enough is enough – the violence needs to stop!

You can expect the unexpected from Strata.</p><p>Hard lyrics over a soulful beat, or his r&amp;b twist, Club Bangers, EDM, his catalog has no limit.</p><p>Every track is REAL RAW AND RELEVANT, and everything the game needs right NOW!
