  <h1>Tooty – Suicidal Thoughts</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><blockquote>"...That's what I believe in, and I'm willing to die for it.</p><p>Period."
– Will Smith.</blockquote>
I've written a number of times about Chicago native  Tooty.</p><p>His management team initially put me onto his debut mixtape <a href="http://Tooty – First Degree Murder | Above Average Hip-Hop">First Degree Murder</a>, which I optimistically reviewed.</p><p>Tooty, I recall initially thinking, was an unexpectedly dope listen; he comes off quite focused, and confident – especially for a newcomer.</p><p>I've been buried in music over the past few weeks, but I've finally been able to sit with his follow-up, <i>Suicidal Thoughts</i>.</p><p>The seven song project is kind of...dark, to say the least; although, at the same time, quite motivating.</p><p>The album has a therapeutic aura about it, almost as though I'm listening to a (slightly) more uptempo version of Biggie's <i>Suicidal Thoughts</i>, with added psychological context.</p><p>Coming from his first album, it's tremendous growth.</p><p>Von Vuai's production perfect – and gives the album depth and consistency.</p><p>Trapo provides bars on the project opener, <i>Underground Railroad </i>– and XVRHLDY lends himself to my fave joint on here, <i>Mile Before Perfect</i>. <i><a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/tootie-stepping-stone/">Stepping Stone</a></i>, which I talked about earlier this quarter when the visuals dropped, is another must-listen.</p><p>He also drops serious nuggets on the Aaliyah sampled,&amp;nbsp;<i>All I Think About</i>: "I might slit my wrists tonight, I might fuck your bitch tonight – I can't be your Superman, baby you my kryptonite."

Aggressive.</p><p>Reflective.</p><p>Cautionary.</p><p>Tooty delivers a solid follow-up to his debut mixtape – and sets the bar for himself this upcoming year.</p><p>Much like the Will Smith excerpts in the album's outro, Tooty knows who he is, and what he believes.</p><p>He is living in pursuit of his dreams; and If the underlying messages in this album are to be believed, he's also willing to die for them!</p><p>Give it a spin!
