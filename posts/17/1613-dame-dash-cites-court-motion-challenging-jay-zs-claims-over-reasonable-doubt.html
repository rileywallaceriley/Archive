  <h1>Dame Dash Cites Court Motion Challenging Jay-Z's Claims Over 'Reasonable Doubt'</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Music mogul Damon Dash has brought attention to a court motion filed by New York State that contradicts <a href="https://amp.tmz.com/2024/08/10/jay-z-stakes-claim-reasonable-doubt-damon-dash/">claims made by Jay-Z </a>regarding ownership rights of the iconic album <em>Reasonable Doubt</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a public statement, Dash read directly from the motion: "This is filed by New York State, not me.</p><p>Jay-Z's statements to the Press have poisoned the environment for the auction.</p><p>He has claimed that he has a termination right under the Copyright Act and that the rights of <em>Reasonable Doubt</em> will revert to him in six years.</p><p>In fact, he has no such termination right."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The motion further states that Roc-A-Fella Records (RAF) "is entitled to Renewal term which is now 67 years, meaning it will own the copyrights until the year 2098."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dash expressed surprise at the lack of media coverage, saying, "I was really surprised that <em>TMZ</em> and that <em>The Breakfast Club</em> and <em>Earn Your Leisure</em> haven't spoken about this, but to me this is something that's very relevant."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He emphasized the potential impact on valuation: "The highest possible auction price could be more than 10 times higher than it is likely now given Jay-Z and RAF's actions."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dash's 33.3% stake in Roc-A-Fella Records is set for auction on August 29, following his failure to pay an $823,000 settlement in a separate legal dispute.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The music executive called for media correction: "Everyone that took the time to repost <em>TMZ, Earn Your Leisure, Breakfast Club</em>, whoever else was talking it, please correct your statement and repost this and let it be known that <em>Reasonable Doubt</em>, the rights stay with Roc-A-Fella Inc for the next 100 years."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This dispute adds another layer to the complex history of Roc-A-Fella Records, founded in 1994 by Jay-Z, Dash, and Kareem "Biggs" Burke.</p><p>The label has been central to several legal battles, including a 2021 lawsuit over Dash's attempt to auction <em>Reasonable Doubt</em> as an NFT.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the auction approaches, the true value and implications of ownership remain in question, with the court motion potentially reshaping the narrative around this high-profile music industry asset.</p>
