  <h1>Tre Cartel – Real M.C.</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Atlanta, home to acts like Usher and the entire Dungeon Family, is busting at the seams with urban talent.</p><p>One of the city's newest voices we've come across is hip-hop singer Tre Cartel.</p><p>His latest EP entitled <i>Real M.C.</i> is currently available pretty much everywhere you can acquire digital music.</p><p>It's a single producer project, with Mizunderstood Ru helming the bulk of the work,  aside from production collabos with BeatzByNasty and BassHaus.</p><p>It's a solid project, and admittedly my introduction to Tre.</p><p>His sound is unique; it's hard to put my finger on, but it makes me think of a slowed/screwed up Bone-Thugs-N-Harmony, blended with cadence elements of A-Plus from Souls Of Mischief -- it stands out.</p><p>The EP is full of slow, bassy, intoxicated ballads -- perfect for midnight movements.</p><p>Tre notes that His main influences are artists such as Tory Lanez, PartNextDoor, The Weeknd, Jimi Hendrix and Wiz Khalifa. <i>Real M.C</i>., which stands for stands for Mizunderstood Cartel, is a subtle nod to all the above while breaking new ground.
