  <h1>#IndieSpotlight: Noah Wright Is Back With His Latest Visual "Cameras"</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>27-year-old American Cedar Rapids MC Noah Wright is back with another super dope video treatment.</p><p>First popping onto our radar back in March with his short film "Valley of the Sun" -- and with his super dope LP <em>Love, Noah</em>.</p><p>From opening for Rakim, Rick Ross, Futuristic and working with Young Money's very own Cory Gunz, he's definitely on a run, and we're here for it.

<h4>Relevant: <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/infectiously-optimistic-meet-rapper-noah-wright/">Check out our March 2018 Noah Wright feature</a></h4>

His latest video for his sure-shot single "Cameras" is next level creative.</p><p>It begins with a plot reminiscent of the iconic episode of Fresh Prince of Bel Air when Will and Buddy were trying to be in the BBD video being shot while Phil and Viv were away.</p><p>In this video, the cleaner keeps trying to be in the shot, interrupting the shoot to the point that Noah storms off.</p><p>That's the opening skit, though.</p><p>As the actual video kicks off, we're introduced to gorgeous models, a luxury car, and that same interrupting cleaner is playing out a virtual reality plotline that eventually intertwines with his performance shots.</p><p>It's the type of creativity we've come to expect from Noah who's been dropping some fire lately.</p><p>The short and sweet "El Chapo," which he dropped back in June, and the intensely powerful visual for "No Room" have been building his profile -- his quality is next level.</p><p>Check out "Cameras" above, and be sure to follow Noah via Twitter.</p></div>
