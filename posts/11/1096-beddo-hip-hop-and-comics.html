  <h1>Beddo: Hip-Hop and Comics</h1>

  <div class="content"><p>Hip-hop and comics are no strangers.</p><p>From enlisting artists to create album covers, to just being book junkies, there has always been a strong relationship – and why not?</p><p>They are two mediums built on the concept of storytelling.</p><p>Their relationship took the front street and set the internet ablaze with the recent release of <a href="https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CBwQFjAAahUKEwjN_5_js9nIAhWJ7iYKHTvXCxw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcomicbook.com%2F2015%2F08%2F11%2Fall-of-marvels-hip-hop-variant-covers-in-one-place%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNEsNU5ESy5iAgJdnsckGh3CE_3x9A&amp;sig2=17fZqx7odrryl9o7yS9Q2A&amp;bvm=bv.105841590,d.dmo">Marvel's variant covers series</a>.</p><p>Accompanying all-new #1's from Marvel Comics coming this season was a variant cover paying homage to some of the most iconic covers in hip-hop's timeline.</p><p>Along that same vein, I came across another a dope artist I thought I'd share with everyone.</p><p>His name is Beddo, and he's a visual artist from Toronto, who uses a unique combination of graffiti, comic book art, and traditional fine arts.</p><p>He launched his latest for at FanExpo in Sept 2015 in the 6, and after being put on to him, I've been following his work on Instagram.</p><p>He's been focusing recently on 'reverse-variant' covers, which flip Marvel's concept.</p><p>He uses his hip-hop to tribute iconic comic book covers, like Amazing Spider-Man #50 by John Romita, Iron Man #128 by Bob Layton and – current work in progress – Secret Wars #1 by Mike Zeck.
