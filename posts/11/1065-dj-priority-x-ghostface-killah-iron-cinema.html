  <h1>DJ Priority x Ghostface Killah - Iron Cinema</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before I get into this, I have two initial confessions.</p><p>One, is that I know DJ Priority, so for the sake of "journalistic integrity", this is more of a <em>suggestive</em> piece than a biased review.</p><p>Secondly, I'm a sucker for remix projects – so now you know, and knowing is half the battle .</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now, DJ Priority – if you're unfamiliar – is an accomplished producer/DJ you should be up on.</p><p>He's a beast on the MPC, and this week, well-timed on #WuWednesday, he dropped his latest project: <em>Iron Cinema</em>.</p><p>The project is two things at once; it's an elaborate Ghostface Killah remix project, and a super dope beat-tape.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At 10 joints long, Priority delivers a sonic bed that compliments the songs so well that they literally sound like actual studio versions.</p><p>Furthermore, even though scattered in selection, the project sounds extremely cohesive.</p><p>If not told otherwise upfront, you'd swear Ghost himself dropped this project.</p><p>Standouts are the super gully remixes of <em>Apollo Kids</em> and <em>Daytona 500</em>.</p><p>As a bonus, the artwork is insane!</p><p>If you're an up and coming artist, or even one of our more <em>established</em> readers, you should definitely hit-up Priority for your next project.</p><p>You can sound <strong>this nice</strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The album can be streamed below.</p><p>If you want to download it, it's a pay what you want situation – so if you enjoyed it, be sure to support it accordingly. </span></p>
