  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Coming straight out of Alberta, Canada, self-sufficient indie rapper Shifty Eyes is reveling in experiences; from supporting major acts across North America, to
frequenting well-known studios, he's building a solid buzz and a stable foundation.

<em>"From the struggles of the street to the hustle of the corporate music industry, Shifty Eyes has emerged as an experienced, professional and extremely talented performing/recording artist."</em>

Having overcome drug addiction at a younger age, he's put it all into his all into music, and the results are beginning to pay off.</p><p>His latest — self-engineered — new mixtape A New Day is a testament to that.</p><p>The hard working Emcee and father of three wants to be a "positive role model for his family and — most importantly — to provide inspiration to aspiring musicians.</p><p>He's bringing something different and working to stand out in a sea of commonalities.</p><p>He was mentored by some of the top producers in the game, while helped him to elevate his engineering skills on this new project — something he's very proud of.</p><p>His latest drop from the project is "Gas And Gods" featuring the much hailed Connecticut artist Apathy and Blacastan, who recently dropped Watson &amp; Holmes alongside producer Stu Bangas.</p><p>Give it a spin.
