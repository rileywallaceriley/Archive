<b>Thanks for spending a little time with us!</b>

No Worries!

<b>So pull back the veil a little bit for us.</p><p>What is the music business like?</b>

Man (shaking head) it is not for the faint of heart, that’s for sure.</p><p>But I love it.</p><p>It’s exhilarating.</p><p>It is the kindof business where everything is oversized.</p><p>When you win, you do so in spectacular fashion.</p><p>When you fail, you do so in spectacular fashion.”

<b>What would you say is the most consistent quality or an artist to have to make it?</b>

There are 2 qualities to have that can help you thrive where others don’t.</p><p>My experience is that the truly successful people in this business have a high tolerance for rejection.</p><p>They are also great sales people.</p><p>Notice I didn’t mention talent in that list.

<b>We did.</p><p>Why is that?</b>

Talent is obviously a big deal but most artist suffer under the delusion that once talent is demonstrated, that labels will come looking for them.</p><p>The truth is that labels reject the most mind blowingly talented artist every day.</p><p>Then they turn around and sign lesser talented artist.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because the lesser talented artist is a better salesman and sold his music to the public in a convincing manner.

<b>Is that how you were able to get so many artists signed?</b>

Yes.</p><p>I have pitched acts to everyone from Justin Timberlake to LA Reid.</p><p>But I never introduce an artist until we have proven that there is public interest.</p><p>That takes the&amp;nbsp;“No” away before they even have time to think it.</p></div>
