  <h1>Dash Flash Needs To Be On Your Playlist</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>East New York  is home to a bustling new talent that I've been <del>sleeping on</del> (unfortunately) backlogged on covering heavily due to -- well -- being a busy professional journalist.</p><p>I get a LOT of music stuffed in my inbox, and I've been loafing, but this kid, Dash Flash, has a lot going for him.</p><p>I first came across him while putting together my weekly playlists earlier this year.</p><p>I stumbled upon his Young Lito assisted "Go," and immediately dug into his other joints on his website, "My City" featuring YungViceCity and "Bad News." From there I found his Soundcloud and bumped his EP.


&amp;nbsp;
With the level of undercover signees building a narrative around their "come up," I've been following Dash Flash's rise carefully -- just based on the great features he was landing -- like Lil' Wayne, Rich The Kid, and the Pink Panther himself, Riff Raff.</p><p>However, it's organic as they come.</p><p>This kid is moving, and as of this past August, he's officially in the game (frfr).

With a newly minted digital distribution deal with California-based Empire Distribution, which distributed such game-changing singles as "Look at Me" by XXXTENTACION, "All the Way Up" by Fat Joe &amp; Remy Ma, "Broccoli" by D.R.A.M., and "Flex (Ooh, Ooh, Ooh)" by Rich Homie Quan, he's on his way to great things.</p><p>Next up?</p><p>A brand new visual alongside Miami-based Zoey Dollaz, which he's been teasing on his Twitter profile.

I've been holding back on this kid, but that stops here.</p><p>Dash Flash is in the group of next up.</p><p>He's worked with some of the best in the business, and with new distribution in place, it's only a matter of time before he bubbles over into the mainstream.</p><p>Early!
