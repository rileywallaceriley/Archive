  <h1>Why I Like Troy Ave (Regardless of Album Sales)</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><span style="line-height: 24px;">It's a weird time in the history of hip-hop.</p><p>The "next-up" generation of artists has been bred in a different climate.</p><p>When you ask them about the old school, they mention names like Nelly and Young Joc – <i>ouch</i>!</p><p>For this reason, many of the more "seasoned" (age wise) tend to, for lack of a better term, hate young hip-hop heads, and a bulk of the ultra-repetitive new brand of trap.</p><p>Although, there are always exceptions to the rule. </span>

Some of the younger cats happened to have cool parents (like us) that made them explore the culture.</p><p>The result is artists like Joey Badass and Bishop Nehru, who authentically sound like the golden era.</p><p>Other new artists just happen to have that "it" factor that made audiences fall in love with hip-hop back in the day; above all, they can spit.</p><p>Two examples of this are A$AP Rocky (and company) and the main subject of this article, Troy Ave.</p><p>I've been listening to Troy for a while now.</p><p>After his recent release, <i>Major Without A Deal</i>, I felt like I needed to get vocal about him, and why he's a good look.</p><p>He's unapologetically hip-hop, very NYC and 100% independent; and <em>real</em> independence isn't something all artists can claim.</p><p>Remember his XXL Freshman cipher?</p><p>He called out everyone else in the line-up for being a bunch of "weirdos".</p><p>Rightfully so.</p><p>In a sea of skinny jeans and funny accessories, he was rocking a mink and counting a stack of money while the others dropped their verses.</p><p>How NYC is that?</p><p>He's flashy, and no gimmicks at the same time.</p><p>Is he cocky?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Does he tell you that he's bringing NYC back too much, maybe – but that's hip-hop!</p><p>It's a cocky, competitive landscape.</p><p>I've seen plenty of journalists bash him for the above two points, but he's continuing to thrive.</p><p>Don't forget, hip-hop is an underdog sport.</p><p>He has a bit of a 50 sound, but honestly, he's a heavy hip-hop head from New York City.</p><p>As if he wasn't at all influenced by 50 – he's the right age.</p><p>He was 17-18 when <em>Get Rich Or Die Trying</em> Dropped.</p><p>So many rappers have blended other rappers into their style.</p><p>This criticism of Troy seems especially dated.</p><p>Mostly because of the actual uniqueness of his voice – and the fact that he doesn't sonically make music like 50.</p><p>I mean, not any more than Action Bronson sounds like Ghost.</p><p>His new album is worth listening to.</p><p>His features alone deserve all the attention they get.</p><p>I mean, hate on the kid all you want.</p><p>But <i>Major Without A Deal</i> has cameos by Puff and Mase, and some of the hottest 16's I've heard from Cam and Fat Joe in a longtime.</p><p>Are all his songs at the peak of originality?</p><p>Let me answer with another question, are anyone?</p><p>Look, hip-hop is like <i>The Simpsons</i>, it has lots of writers and over 30+ years has touched on just about everything.</p><p>Troy knows his roots and is going as hard as he can to rep his city.</p><p>I've seen lots of journalists who hated on this cat while praising artists like French Montana ( and the like) in the same breath.</p><p>Stop hating.</p><p>Apparently not dressing like a hipster and making NYC street hop – with his slant – makes him cliché.</p><p>All the while, every artist that follows the current wave of similarity is praised for their über creativity.</p><p>Weak.</p><p>Despite what album sales say (and thanks to bootlegging and streaming they are subjective), his new album is definitely worth some spins.</p><p>If his new radio single <i>Doo Doo</i> is any indication, he's ready and willing to play ball.</p><p>That means you're going to be seeing much more of him.
