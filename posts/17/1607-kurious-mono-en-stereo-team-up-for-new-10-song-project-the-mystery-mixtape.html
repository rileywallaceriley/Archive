<p>For those not fully up on Kurious, he first gained attention in the early 1990s New York hip-hop scene.</p><p>In 1994, he released his debut album <em>A Constipated Monkey</em> through Hoppoh Recordings, an imprint created by Bobbito Garcia and Pete Nice of 3rd Bass, in partnership with Columbia Records, who at the same time was preparing the release of two other young upstarts named Nas and Big L.</p>

<p>He even collaborated with the late underground hip-hop icon MF DOOM, appearing on DOOM's 1999 album <em>Operation: Doomsday</em>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After his debut album, Kurious took a hiatus from releasing music due to what he described as a "terrible" contract with Sony.</p><p>He later reemerged in the late 1990s and has been especially active in recent years.</p><p>In late 2023, he dropped the <em><a href="https://weaponizerecords.bandcamp.com/album/monkeyman">Monkeyman</a></em> LP, produced by Cut Beetlez.</p>
