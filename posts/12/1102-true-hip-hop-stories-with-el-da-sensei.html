  <div class="meta">Thu, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>One of the reasons I love social media so much, aside from the fact that it pays my bills, is following the day to day accounts of artists I've always admired or looked up to.</p><p>If you consider yourself a 90s hip-hop head at all, you're likely familiar with The Artifacts, who crafted my fave hip-hop song of all time, Wrong Side Of The Tracks.</p><p>Well, I follow both El Da Sensei and Tame on the Facebook machine, and they both post gold.</p><p>El, in particular, has been sharing some amazing memories and stories every #throwbackthursday.</p><p>With his blessing, I'm committing to sharing some of them here with all of you!</p><p>So here's this week's story courtesy El Da Sensei.</p><p>The following story – still in its original form – accompanied the video below.
