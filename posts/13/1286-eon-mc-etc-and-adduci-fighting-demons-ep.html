  <h1>Eon MC Etc. And Adduci -- Fighting Demons [EP]</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sun, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Eon MC Etc.</p><p>And Adduci, a duo that came across my desk this week, were hard to get into for me—and that's no fault of theirs.</p><p>It's also not an insult or a reflection of the quality of their music.</p><p>It's just that in 2016, with the current wave of similarity I'm being fed on a daily basis, I don't often come across an alt-hip-hop project that makes me stop and think/listen in a different way.</p><p>While the genre's use of the term 'alternative' has grown to include acts like Chance The Rapper or even—at one point—Lil'B, I choose to use it the way it was originally conceived.</p><p>That was, to describe acts against the grain, disrupting hegemony like De La Soul or Arrested Development.</p><p>Eon MC Etc.</p><p>And Adduci  hail from different parts of the country, but come together with a unique style that both contrasts and compliments in harmonious balance.</p><p>Their new project, Fighting Demons, seems to be ripe with symbolism, Lyricist Lounge-esque poetry aesthetic, spiritual undertones, and a unique thematic direction.</p><p>The project kicks off with a seething commentary on 'false prophets' with "Apocalypse," packed with bars and 8-bar hooks that depict a pastor dripping in anti-church hypocrisy.</p><p>Highlights here are joints like "Lady Liberty," where they drop lines like "Dear Lady Liberty, got a special delivery, a weapon of mass destruction for the corruption and tyranny." Then there's the outro, "Lonely Highway," with its eerie atmosphere, and deep bars.</p><p>It's hard to describe adequately without simply retyping all the lyrics, but bar-wise, this project is super ill.</p><p>Eon MC Etc.'s verse on "Ghetto Birds," for example, show how seasoned he is—this is by no means an amateur project.</p><p>It's a gem, real talk.</p><p>What stood out was their 8-minute mini-movie/video for "Grindin' In My Zone," with its chorus that chastises non-unique heads that come with that mediocre bullshit.</p><p>The video depicts the duo as what I understand to be demon hunters who are attending some anything goes demon party.</p><p>It's incredibly well-executed and quite impressive.</p><p>Overall, it's a unique project in a sea of shit that is trying way too hard to fit in.</p><p>Worth a listen for anyone who is a fan of acts with the courage to keep it real and be themselves; Fighting Demons is AAHH approved.</p></div>
