  <h1>Danny Brown, MF Doom And More Guest On The Avalanches' Wildflower</h1>

  <div class="content"><p>I’m a writer — obviously — and I’m usually on it.</p><p>But I must admit, for a good part of the early 2000s, I was an artist myself, slugging it out in the studio, flipping through beat tapes, combing record shops for rare 90s instrumentals, and getting lit .</p><p>I also, as hard as I tried, missed out on some arguably essential musical phenomenon.</p><p>One such universally, and critically hailed, highlight was The Avalanches’ <em>Since I Left You</em>, a 3500 sample melting pot of hip-hop, EDM, and soul infused art hailed as one of the top 10 albums of the decade.</p><p>Rightfully so — The Australian export was a hungry crate digger's dream.</p><p>A thought provoking soundtrack to a sweaty summer night.</p><p>How the fudge did I miss it?</p><p>Well, I caught up — and have spent the better part of the month enjoying their (long awaited) follow-up, <em>Wildflower</em>.</p><p>It’s quite literally the best listening experience you’ll have this month.</p><p>It’s hip-hop, it’s classic samples, it’s upbeat — it’s perfect.</p><p>Off the bat, if you only have time for one  listen, pop on track three, "Frankie Sinatra," featuring Detroit swag-god, Danny Brown, and the incomparable MF Doom.</p><p>Danny also appears on "The Wozard Of Iz." Other guests include the diabolical Biz Markie, delivering his usual level of bizarre Biz-ness on “The Noisy Eater,” and the “Lucini” duo, Camp-Lo, on the soulful 70s “Because I’m Me.” 

To understand the work that went into this album is to know the love and care that the group puts into their craft.</p><p>Recorded over the period 16 years, amongst illness,  comings and goings, sample clearance issues, and a lack of rumors, the album is a masterpiece, and one of the finest examples of plunderphonics you’re likely to find.</p><p>If you’re a fan of producers like J.Rocc, you need to get up on this album — immediately.</p><p>Bonus, this mash-up video is insane.
