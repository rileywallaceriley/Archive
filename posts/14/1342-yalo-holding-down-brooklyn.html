"I'm an inspiring on the rising artist from East New York, with dreams of making it out of the rough streets of Brooklyn and one day making a large impact on the Hip Hop culture.</p><p>I started rapping back in high school at lunch tables, doing talent shows until my brother Marc, heard me rap a 16 to him &amp; he was impressed by the creative wordplay.</p><p>He then soon began to push me into working on a small project just rapping over old school Brooklyn beats &amp; we decided to call it "I Love Brooklyn" At the time I still was in high school, and there was a lot of procrastination occurring, and I wasn't as focused.</p><p>Four years later I got back into being serious and finished up the project and now will be releasing it in February 2017."
