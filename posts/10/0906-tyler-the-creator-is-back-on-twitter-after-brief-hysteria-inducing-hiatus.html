  <div class="meta">2017-04-05 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>After making it through a death hoax in March, 3.7 million Hip Hop fans woke up this week to a grim discovery — Tyler The Creator's Twitter account had been deactivated.</p><p>Although his bio, which fans managed to snap before the account went down, read “high chance I delete this and insta,” some fans didn't take the threat seriously, especially given the nature of Tyler's hilarious and often erratic timeline.He has since made a glorious return, but reactions on Twitter during the downtime ranged from the reposting of his infamous cyber bullying tweet in memorial to comically dramatic outbursts.Take a look at some of the reactions below.At least one user did have the ingenuity to question whether this was, in fact, a stunt — considering that his other social accounts remained intact.</p><p>The social media reset strategy is one that Meek Mill, Future and Kendrick Lamar have all experimented with within the past six months on Instagram.Tyler was not the first artist to quit Twitter, to the horror of fans.</p><p>Jaden Smith, Nicki Minaj, and Fifth Harmony's Normani Kordei, for example, have all dropped the platform — even if just temporarily.</p><p>Tyler has now reactivated the account, just as followers were beginning to figure out how to continue living in a brave new world without having his Twitter as a source of entertainment.</p><p>Understandably, fans are relieved.</p><p>In other Tyler news, check out this clip from his Cherry Bomb documentary premiere.</p></div>
