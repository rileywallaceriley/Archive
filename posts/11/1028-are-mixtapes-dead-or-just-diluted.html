  <h1>Are Mixtapes Dead, Or Just Diluted?</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Are mixtapes dead?</p><p>Yes – well, actually...no.</p><p>Kind of?</p><p>I mean, as a format, yes.</p><p>Handing a copy of your burned cd to someone is essentially the same as a grocery store or bank handing out promotional frisbees at a BBQ.</p><p>It's a digital game now, yet we hold on to the term for dear life.</p><p>Why not call them a digital compilation of songs that infringe copyrights, hence this isn't official?</p><p>That's a generalization, but you get the point!

<em></em>

Mixtapes have a long history and tradition.</p><p>It may be hard for younger heads to remember, but they used to be actual tapes – and to top it off they were <em>actually</em> mixed.</p><p>I'll pause while you compose yourself.</p><p>You either had an actual DJ mixing actual records together, or there was a pause/play element used for those who didn't have their music on wax or own decks.</p><p>That eventually evolved into unreleased songs simply being "arranged".</p><p>This evolution gave rise to a breed of DJ that simply arranged and played songs, rather than <em>actual</em> mixing – leading to some confusion about the vital role a skilled DJ can play in the culture.</p><p>As someone who is obsessed with actual mixing, I kind of think you're missing out by not having your music actually mixed by a real DJ.</p><p>The barrier to entry, which was pressing vinyl, is now equalized due to the likes of Serato. <strong>No excuses</strong>.</p><p>Anyways, I digress.</p><p>Are mixtapes dead?</p><p>Well, plenty of artists have either created or lived careers in the circuit, like 50 Cent, Lupe Fiasco, Dipset, and Mac Miller; however, the format is flooded.</p><p>Sites like DatPiff post like "a million" mixtapes a day, many of questionable quality (all around).</p><p>The only barrier to entry that current exists is that you can record songs – original beats not necessary – and make a cover of some sort.</p><p>Mixtapes, as far as I can tell, have almost digressed into a collection of songs that artists aren't willing to label as an official EP or album.</p><p>Of course that's assuming it's even an official tape.</p><p>Essentially my point is that the term has become polluted...kind of like the concept that rap and hip-hop aren't the same thing.</p><p>One of the main elements of hip-hop has been watered down to an extreme, which I find troubling.</p><p>Maybe it's time to either re-name, re-format or create a barrier to entry into the mixtape game?</p><p>Maybe force an artist to create a respectable demo/album first?</p><p>Maybe a stricter curation process?</p><p>Just food for though.</p><p>Let's take a moment and salute actual DJ's who create <em>actual</em> mixtapes – and the next generation of turntable warriors.</p></div>
