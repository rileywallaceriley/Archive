  <h1>Shelita Burke Gives Brain Orgasms With Her New Single</h1>

  <div class="content"><p>Indie.</p><p>Quirky.</p><p>Unique.</p><p>Those are just a few ways that one may choose to describe singer and songwriter Shelita Burke.</p><p>For the last few months, she's been constantly popping up on my radar, and having taken some time to catch up, and learn more about her; it's easy to see why!</p><p>She was on NPR's list of artists that I need to keep on my radar and -- as well -- that MTV artist status that artists seem to brag about in their press releases all the time?</p><p>Yeah, she's ranked in the top 10.</p><p>Needless to say, there's something about her that is clicking with listeners.</p><p>Her first EP, <i>Transfixed</i>, is a mellow, acoustic vibe that highlight her hauntingly unique voice and personal songwriting.</p><p>As a sidebar, It also reached #14 on Amazon's top music chart.</p><p>She almost -- but not quite -- puts me in the mind of Corinne Baily Rae, only slightly from a cadence perspective.</p><p>Her grind is incredible; I'd be remiss not to mention that.</p><p>She's been touring overseas; playing self-generated dates in France, Japan, Canada, Wales, and more.</p><p>This globetrotter perspective  has been slowly amalgamating with her sound, and her upcoming EP, Five, seems to pick up where her first EP left off, with an EDM-infused remix of the title track.</p><p>She's leading the new project, which will be available this October, with the single "Belong," super cool track I spent the last few sweaty summer evenings listening to on repeat.</p><p>What's unique about her is that there's this certain  about her music that you're unable to put your finger on until you explore her liner notes; she's been experimenting with Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR).</p><p>She explains it as "a pleasurable tingling 'brain tickle' effect.</p><p>She -- consequently -- incorporates unique vocal runs into her music that give listeners what she calls “brain orgasms." Her quirky vocals make love to your mind; tell me that isn't the most unique thing you've ever heard!</p><p>I dare you.</p><p>Her new EP was produced by Bellringer, a wildly successful producer whose worked with the likes of Diddy, Nicki Minaj, Usher, and Britney Spears -- not to mentions brands like McDonald's.</p><p>She's in good hands.</p><p>The first single is an exciting look at what we have to look forward to this October.</p><p>In the meantime, get familiar with her work -- Shelita Burke is an artist who is worth your time.</p><p>If you don't believe NPR, and the legion of fans who've helped her climb the ranks as an MTV artist -- or even the fans she's earned one by one around the world on tour -- then believe me.</p><p>She's a name you'll hear about -- sooner than later.
