<p><strong>Introduce yourself</strong>

They call me Venomiss!</p><p>I'm a female MC and Hip Hop Journalistic Writer from Orange, NJ.</p><p>I write for a few blogs and magazines and I do my own music as an independent artist.

<strong>How did you get involved in music?</strong>

Music was always around me in one way or another so it all kind of came together.</p><p>My mom loved music and there was never a day in my house without music playing when I was young...</p><p>Bob Marley, Sade, Kenny G, The Gap Band, Luther... you name it.</p><p>I became in love with music.</p><p>My dad was into being a DJ and he would let me practice, so I developed a ear for rhythms and drum patterns.</p><p>He had some bars too!</p><p>When I got older, my cousins were a huge part of me getting involved since they were heavy into hip hop and in rap groups of their own.</p><p>Music became my happy place in life.</p><p>It became my escape and my voice when I didn't think I had the courage to face the things I was up against.</p><p>At the same time I don't think any one thing made me a MC, I believe it developed naturally in me and was brought out by events in my life both good and bad.

<strong>Who are some of your influences?</strong>

Honestly, most of the people who influence will never see a deal or the mainstream recognition.</p><p>As a MC who started out literally walking up to groups of MCs that I didn't know who were in a cypher and basically jumping into their rotation, being around others who are hungry and creative influences me most.</p><p>I didn't care who's hood I was in, what street I was on or who's shows, I just needed to be in the cypher!</p><p>In turn, I met a lot of really talented MCs who I learned a lot from.</p><p>Personal experiences and life lessons also influence me.</p><p>Things I've seen or done.</p><p>I draw influence from moods too I am definitely a mood writer.</p><p>Sometimes the beat will influence me to write to a certain feeling I'm having.

<strong>Tell me about your music.</strong>

I've been doing music since I was about 12 or 13, and took it seriously about 15 or 16.</p><p>My music is about balance.</p><p>I bring the street edge and I also bring hooks and lyrics that people can still go along with.</p><p>I'm not so far old school Hip Hop that I can't also appreciate and bring the new school Hip Hop too.I find young and old Hip Hop heads like my music.</p><p>They all seem to find something they like about it.</p><p>I saw a post on Twitter one time from a good friend of mine that reminds me of my music.</p><p>It made me laugh actually when I saw it.</p><p>The post was about being sophisticated ratchet.</p><p>That describes my music to me.</p><p>The post was saying sophisticated ratchet is hood enough to step up but smart enough to know when to.</p><p>That's how I feel about my music.</p><p>It's not too left field that you can't respect it, but it ain't above taking the earnings off and showing you the business either!

<strong>Tell me about your sound.</strong>

The most common feedback I get about my sound is my voice.</p><p>I'm told I have a great voice for hip hop and radio often.</p><p>People look for someone to compare it to but they generally just go back to saying they like the way my voice sounds on the beats when they can't find a direct match in their minds.</p><p>My choice of production things that grab your attention.</p><p>I like a little bounce to my records; almost a southern bounce without it being trap.</p><p>I do draw some southern influences and I guess that comes from being a fan of Bone Thugs, but I am a Jersey girl born and raised so I also draw influences from Fabolous, Jay-Z, Jadakiss too.</p><p>I guess I just like to be able to bounce to the beat.

<strong>What are you currently working on?</strong>

I just dropped the video for "<i>They Want</i>" which has been one of two singles off the upcoming album.</p><p>I started out with the mindset that I was recording an EP but its honestly been so hard to narrow it down.</p><p>My producers and I really have just been working off of our vibes and creating with no limitation.</p><p>So I believe its growing from an EP to a full project.</p><p>I've been in the studio a lot and focusing on making this a good project.</p><p>Speaking of the album, it should be out soon.</p><p>Stay tuned to my Twitter and website because I will be announcing dates in the upcoming weeks.</p><p>I'm still writing for the blogs and magazines and honing my skills in that department too.</p><p>Its been a great addition to my music to be able to write about something I love.</p><p>I have some other behind the scenes ventures i'm exploring too.

<strong>What are your fave albums ever?</strong>

I can't narrow this down, I would be kidding myself if I said I could.</p><p>Some of my favorite albums ever are:
</p><p></p><ul>
	<li>Notorious B.I.G- <i>Life after Death</i></li>
	<li>Busta Rhymes- <i>E.L.E</i></li>
	<li>Wu Tang- <i>Forever</i></li>
	<li>Lauryn Hill- <i>Miseducation of Lauryn Hill</i></li>
	<li>Miss E Elliot- <i>So Addictive</i></li>
	<li>DMX-<i> It's Dark and Hell is Hot</i></li>
	<li>Jay-Z <i>Reasonable Doubt</i></li>
	<li>Nas- <i>Illmatic</i></li>
	<li>Bone Thugs n Harmony - <i>Creeping On a Come Up</i></li>
	<li>Ruff Ryders- <i>Ryde Or Die Vol 1</i>&amp;nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>
...Just to name a few that really stuck with me over the years and that aren't as obvious.</p><p>My all-time collection usually includes albums that changed the game in some way with their release.</p><p>They either change the way we see something, or set a tone of some sort.

<strong>Do you perform live?</p><p>Describe how you approach a live show.</strong>

Performing live is really important in music.</p><p>You have to do it.</p><p>I do it and even at my first show, I have never been shy.</p><p>I get on stage and nothing else matters to me but performing.</p><p>My approach to a show is to give the best performance I can.</p><p>Not all venues are going to be the best venue, not all are going to have a great sound system and be packed.</p><p>I just get up there and have a good time and I try my best to connect with the audience and give them a good idea of who I am.
