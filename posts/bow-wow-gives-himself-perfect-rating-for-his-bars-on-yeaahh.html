    <div class="content"><p>In the latest installment of BET's Rate The Bars series, Bow Wow sat in the hot seat and gave his take on the lyrics of artists such as Royce Da 5'9", Trippie Redd and -- of course -- himself."You know me, I play against the rules," he said before awarding Redd a respectable score for a four-bar sequence from "In Too Deep." He even offered some advice on how he would have improved the punchline "keep a Glock never trust a hoe" by adding an additional reference: "keep a Glock, never trust an op."https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bC4TM1HkUAUBow Wow didn't attempt to be modest, giving his bars on the song "Yeaahh" a perfect score. He also awarded five stars to his mentor Jermaine Dupri for the rhymes on the "Welcome To Atlanta" remix as well as Nickel Nine's lyrics from "N My Zone: Mask Off."Overall, the lowest score was awarded to Chris Brown.</p>
