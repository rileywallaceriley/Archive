    <h1>Thaddeus Dixon’s Debut Single Is A Slice Of 90s Nostalgia</h1>
    <div class="meta">2018-10-26 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Platinum-selling songwriter — and producer/musician — Thaddeus Dixon is stepping out into the spotlight with his brand new single, “Letter To My X’s,” his official debut. Having helped craft hits for names like Khalid, Ariana Grande, Meghan Trainor, and Bryson Tiller, it’s finally his time to shine.</p>
<p>The song, which dropped October 23, is a healthy dose of 90s nostalgia intertwined with a booming new school vibe. Every element of the track is all Dixon, from the writing right down to each instrument, including drums — which Dixon played all week long as a featured musician on NBC’s Late Night with Seth Meyers.It also features “Superfly” actor/rapper KR, who is currently in custody and — as of October 26 — is being charged with nine counts of sexual assault.Check out the track, below.https://youtu.be/ZH5yf6GnXCs</p></div>
