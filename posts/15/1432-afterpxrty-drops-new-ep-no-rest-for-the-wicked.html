  <h1>AfterPxrty Drops New EP, 'No Rest For The Wicked'</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>We've been rocking with Michigan-based rapper AfterPxrty for the past few projects now, and he keeps developing, while staying faithful to the original vibe that drew us in on <em>The Saints Say Amen</em>, which peaked at 16 on iTunes — that's a big deal.</p><p>After his initial success, he started his imprint, Global Money Group LLC, which already has ten releases under its belt.</p><p>With a larger platform at stake, I immediately expected something serious from him.</p><p>Naturally, without hesitation, I plugged in the aux cable and took a night right to give the homie's project a spin — here's what I thought.

<em>No Rest For The Wicked</em> is an eight-song EP full of big bars and even bigger production.</p><p>In the past I compared his (very) slightly unorthodox but commanding flow to west coast legend Saafir; I'm doubling down.</p><p>From the onset of the first track, "Republic" — overflowing with video game references intertwined with lamenting about the grind-time he's put in — you know this project is AfterPxrty going Super Saiyan.</p><p>While the project doesn't venture too far out of the bass-filled pocket he sets up, which gives it a sonic cohesiveness, he does poke his head out a few times. "Blade - Runner" stands out with its atmospheric sampled beat, giving him more of a "rappidy-rap" soundscape to beat down.</p><p>Another stand out for me was "No Rest," which I found myself going back to more than twice after my first run-through; the subtle bass switch on the chorus is nasty (for lack of a better term).

"A Million Questions" comes through with a face-paced beat that sounds like it was stolen off of Meek's latest track list. "Ask that Eagle why he flies, nigga ... ask that lion why he king, nigga; ask that king about that dream, nigga," he states in the chorus.</p><p>Missed opportunity: the hottest beat on this project, in my opinion, was the "Wealthy Street Interlude," which he didn't bless at all!</p><p>Overall, it's the best we've heard so far from the Grand Rapids rapper; we'll have to keep an eye on this one to see if he can repeat the charting success he had with<em> The Saints Say Amen</em>.</p><p>Worth a spot on your busy weekend playlist, though.
