  <h1>Work Fi Mi: An Interview With Yellow Cloud</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sun, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><blockquote>“We make music.</p><p>Of course, with a Hip-Hop base but also sprinkled with Jazz, Funk, Dancehall, Rock, Folk, Salsa, etc. man.</p><p>I mean, for real, the list goes on and on and on—and on!</p><p>We love art…but we hate labels!”
—Yellow Cloud</blockquote>
Washington, DC, duo Yellow Cloud have a cool vibe about them.</p><p>Former bandmates—and longtime friends—TreeLag and Nick Wood have a 90s hip-hop aesthetic, infused with live jazz instrumentation and contemporary rhyme schemes to great their unique new wave.</p><p>Their latest record, "Work Fa Mi," is not that unfamiliar thematically, but the jazzy saxophone kissed instrumental vibe give it an unusually vintage feel; as does the video, which reminds us of classic 90s house party videos, like Notorious B.I.G's "One More Chance," for example.</p><p>Taking time out from creating, the duo sat with AAHH to discuss their music, their influences, and what they have coming up on the horizon.</p><p>Check out the video—and their interview—below.



<b>Tell me about yourself -- what got you involved in music? </b>

<b>Nick Wood</b>: I couldn't even tell you.</p><p>I mean, it must be my family.</p><p>I've been involved in music as long as I can remember.

<b>TreeLag</b>: I think music got me involved in life!</p><p>I don't know what got me involved in music because I've always been involved in music.</p><p>I mean, I was born with a song I still jam to today – it was played by my uncle.</p><p>Music has just always been a part of me and my life.

<b>Coming into this game, who did you look up to?</b>

<b>N</b>: When I first started rapping, I was all about Lil Wayne and Dipset.</p><p>They made music fun, and my friends and I knew all their lyrics.</p><p>But my first real personal inspiration to make this music came from seeing A Tribe Called Quest live.</p><p>They motivated me in a way I didn't know possible.</p><p>Q-Tip became my father.

<b>T</b>: , for real.</p><p>I looked up to people like Queen, Journey, Michael
Jackson, The Temptations, Bob Marley and Peter Tosh.</p><p>The way these musicians performed and impacted the world is something so powerful to me.</p><p>Talking about the rap game specifically, though, I was looking up to Dipset, Big Pun, Hot Boyz, TRU, Bone Thugs, the old Terror Squad, and Fugees!</p><p>I grew up in the 90s with mad older role models who were bumping that fire!</p><p>I—for real—always looked up to Bone Thugs and especially Bizzy Bone!</p><p>Then, when we got to go on tour with him, it was like a dream come true!</p><p>He was even like "Damn, that dude got flow," talking about ya boy right here after he seeing us perform with technical difficulties and still keeping the place live and bumpin!&amp;nbsp;

<b>Tell me about your music; what have you released thus far? </b>

<b>N</b>: The releases have just begun.</p><p>We debuted our single, "Straight Out the Dungeon" back in July, followed by this video for "Work Fa Mi." Now that we've established a groove we can start to release the dozens of singles we have in store.</p><p>Those are coming up as soon as y'all watch "Work Fa Mi" enough.

<b>T</b>: Oooooooooh baby!</p><p>Yeah, like Nasty said, the releases have just begun!</p><p>We got projects with our famo in DC at FHTMG and Les Autres, our international fam in Cuba, Malcolm Beybe, and so many singles, visuals, merch and full-on films for y'all!</p><p>Get at our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/yellowcloudproductions">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://www.instagram.com/yellowcloud202">IG</a> pages to stay updated.

<b>What are you working on right now?</b>

<b>N</b>: Finishing the project, <i>Treezus vs. the Magnificent</i>.</p><p>I also have a solo EP that should be done in a couple of months; and one of our associates, Brandon Moulden, has a project coming up that I'm producing for.</p><p>Very excited about that.</p><p>There's  further collaborations with Alpha Diallo of Les Autres, as well as Pacman Slim of FHTMG.</p><p>We got mad projects with FHTMG.

<b>T</b>: <i>TREEZUS vs.</p><p>THE MAGNIFICENT</i>!!!</p><p>Haha, it's gonna be amazing!</p><p>Also, got some more projects on the way, like I said, with our DC famo as well as our international familia!</p><p>I got a few classics, accompanied by visuals, done with Malcolm Beybe's Escobar and Saez! (two amazing rappers out of Parraga in La Habana, Cuba).</p><p>Also got a solo project in stores, with some very different and fun vibes fi y'all!</p><p>Finally, a project with OJALA.</p><p>Yellow Cloud will be entirely official and taking over the scene within the next year, baby!

<b>Let's talk about this video -- where was it filmed?</p><p>Why are you excited about it? </b>

<b>N</b>: It was filmed in Philly, where I just moved away from.</p><p>I'm just so excited about finally putting it out!</p><p>It's our highest quality video to date.</p><p>That's why I only mentioned two songs before because this new stuff is really on a whole different level as far as professional quality.</p><p>I also love the team we worked with, Unchained Media, and their director Dan Foster.</p><p>I love their style that they brought to the video; it's very cinematic.</p><p>And retro.</p><p>It reminds me a bit of how Goodfellas was filmed.

<b>T</b>: WATCH THAT SHIT! , for real!</p><p>Nasty explained most of it, shoutout Unchained Media!</p><p>This is our very first single released off our upcoming album and comes with a visual...</p><p>I'm just excited as shit it all happened!</p><p>Can't wait for y'all to see all the rest!

<b>What have been your biggest accomplishments to date? </b>

<b>N</b>: Staying alive .</p><p>Nah, but I'm always proud to be putting out music that's constantly improving.</p><p>Every project I put out is better than the last.</p><p>I teach music as well, so I'm happy to be able to have that balance.</p><p>I practice what I preach.</p><p>As a team we're building a very solid footing, so to speak.</p><p>We have so much in store we're just focused on how we present it right now.</p><p>T:  I don't like to talk personal.</p><p>What I will say, is that I feel my biggest accomplishment has been getting to where I am right now!</p><p>I'm alive, healthy, in love, and making music with all the homies.</p><p>Yellow Cloud is coming along, and I can't complain.</p><p>I feel pretty accomplished; so much more work to be done, but I'm psyched that I'm here!

<b>What do you want people to ultimately take away from you as an artist? </b>

<b>N</b>: Authenticity.</p><p>I mean that's what's always important in art.</p><p>That and the effort.</p><p>Both are evident in this video.</p><p>That's why it's a good starting point for y'all to get to know us.</p><p>Yellow Cloud is real; we represent the people.

<b>T</b>: JUST MY ART, Leave me alone! .</p><p>I ultimately want people to
get any feeling at all.</p><p>I make my music when I'm happy, sad, mad, feeling fun,
groovin', etc., and I just want to keep making more for people to explore themselves and possibly gain some sense of understanding; and if they
don't, at least just bop their heads playing one of our jams over and over again.</p><p>Then I can die a happy artist!

<b>What's next for you professionally? </b>

<b>N</b>: See question number 4.</p><p>We have projects; we're working on putting them out.</p><p>And we're still working on new projects.</p><p>I have a growing base of
people I'm mixing for and producing for so that all leads to more collaboration.</p><p>It's all just getting started.

<b>T</b>: I explained a lot of the work in progress and shit that I/we got in store, but y'all ain't hip to my eyes baby!</p><p>Once the money gets up and I can get my hands on a decent camera, y'all ain't even gonna be ready!</p><p>YELLOW CLOUD PRODUCTIONS IN FULL EFFECT!</p><p>The shit I see, and how I see it, ain't something you see on the daily.</p><p>Even without a cam of my own, I still manage, though, and we'll be releasing some Treezus produced material soon.</p><p>I also have a lot of design work I'm working on, so keep a look out for Yellow Cloud and Treezus gear!</p><p>Speaking of, Yellow Cloud tees will be available no later than Nov. 10th, and pics will be posted on our FB and IG pages.</p><p>If you are interested in any merch or have any questions about booking, featuring, etc., please feel free to contact us.
