  <h1>DC Rapper Miko Suave Brings Back The Post Y2K Mixtape Feel</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Washington, D.C., rapper Miko Suave sounds like a lost relic in a sea of drops we've received this week. "I would describe my style as a gumbo of all the greats," he says about his style, "I study all the greats to become greater--and I don't do this for the money; I do it for the love of the sport first!" His latest effort <em>G.E.M.$. (GREEN EYED MONSTER$)</em>, available on DatPiff, is a hefty  collection of music that most closely resembles the mixtape circuit of 2002-2004 that dominated the streets of New York City and made stars out of outfits like G-Unit and Dipset.</p><p>With raw sounding tracks (that have a <em>ripped from somewhere</em> aesthetic), streetwise bars, and hella punchlines, the project--although a big listen at 20 shots--is a great listen none the less.</p><p>Let's start with the goods: there is a lot here.</p><p>I'll be honest and admit that at such a big length--based on my lifestyle--I found it difficult to donate enough of my time to give it a straight through; consequently I did it in chunks.</p><p>This isn't an issue, as the project doesn't flow like a straight narrative by any means, but rather a collection of songs.</p><p>Some of the production feels a little dated, like "We Livin'" that has a Cassidy, "Hustlin'," backbone to it, but for the most part, it's well curated.</p><p>He hits his stride on records like "Rollin' In His Grave" where he calls out rappers with fake images, claiming they  have Pac and Big rolling in they graves--amidst a heap of hip-hop references that show off his knowledge of the culture.</p><p>Also, his flow on "90z Shit" was on-point; this project is also timely, with not-so-subtle commentary on the perceived rise of systematic racism and injustice we're  to see as the result of Trump taking office: "He's a billionaire and money is the root of all evil."
.</p><p>Overall, the 24-year-old rapper--with a cadence that resembles Cassidy blended with young upstart <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/meet-chris-rivers-son-late-great-big-pun/">Chris Rivers</a>--shows a ton of potential; it would be interesting to hear him on a more polished, focused project--but he more than has my attention.
