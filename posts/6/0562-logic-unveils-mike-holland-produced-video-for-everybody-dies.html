  <h1>Logic Unveils Mike Holland-Produced Video For ”Everybody Dies”</h1>
  <div class="meta">2018-09-19 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>After dropping off the first single from his Young Sinatra IV LP, “Everybody Dies,” earlier this month, bi-racial rhymer Logic delivers an official video for the CuBeatz and 6ix-produced track.Directed by Mike Holland, his official Everybody Tour photographer and the man responsible for his splashy ”Contra” visual, the video is big on simplicity.</p><p>The treatment itself is little more than dramatic performance shots, eerie colors — and large empty space.Slated to drop on September 28 via Def Jam, Logic has already announced that the entire Wu-Tang Clan are set to appear on what will be the first entry in his Young Sinatra series to be billed a studio album.</p><p>It’s just one of the seven projects he claimed to have locked and loaded earlier this summer via his Twitter.While he has yet to reveal the entire tracklist, the “Everybody Dies” video can be viewed up above.</p></div>
