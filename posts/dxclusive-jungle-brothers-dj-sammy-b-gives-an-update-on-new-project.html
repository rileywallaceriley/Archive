    <h1>#DXCLUSIVE: Jungle Brothers' DJ Sammy B Gives An Update On New Project</h1>
    <div class="meta">2018-11-23 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>The pioneers of fusing jazz, Hip Hop, and house genres, Jungle Brothers, have a new project in the works — and that’s no secret. Group member Mike Gee first detailed it in an interview this past August.“We’ve basically got a whole album in the can,” he noted. “We’re trying to polish it off right now.”It appears we may now have a better idea of the what and when, as member/producer DJ Sammy B tells HipHopDX the project (which is actually a mixtape titled Bushcamp The Mixtape) is 21 years in the making.“It started in 1997 during the making of Raw Deluxe ... we were in the studio and created a promo for The Red Alert Show called ‘This Is For The Ladies.’” As Sammy explains, it just became back-burner after that. “I had to finish it before leaving here.”When it comes to timeline for the untitled project, Sammy simply says "No set date.</p>
<p>I’m not rushing it ... [I] want it to be right. Getting publishing and everything right."The first taste of what’s to come dropped on November 18. “Ain’t A Trapper,” the first leak from the mixtape, features Wales-based MC, itzSAYKRIDD.As the album gets finalized, check out the new video for “Ain’t A Trapper” above.</p></div>
