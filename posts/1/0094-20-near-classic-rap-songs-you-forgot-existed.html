  <h1>20 Near-Classic Rap Songs You Forgot Existed</h1>
  <div class="meta">2020-06-07 — editorials</div>
  <div class="content"><p>It’s always fun to reminisce over forgotten hit songs — whether one-hit wonders or bangers buried under catalogs overflowing with success.</p><p>But what about the songs that never quite clinch the top spot, or in some cases, generate buzz without hitting the charts at all?</p><p>In a landscape that has changed so significantly over the past two decades, some tracks have just become lost in the shuffle.Here at HipHopDX, we’ve compiled a list that pays tribute to some amazing songs you likely forgot even existed — or perhaps have never even heard.The Madd Rapper f.</p><p>Eminem - “Stir Crazy” (1999)﻿There was a lot to love about the criminally forgotten 1999 LP Tell 'Em Why U Madd by Bad Boy Producer Deric “D-Dot” Angelettie’s alter-ego Madd Rapper.</p><p>For starters, it was the official debut of 50 Cent on the song ”How To Rob.” It was also the debut of a young Kanye West, whom D-Dot managed and mentored in his early days (a role which Ye more accurately described as ghost producing for free).</p><p>The Chicago icon was behind the boards for this Slim Shady era Eminem feature, unbeknownst to many.Don Trip - “Allen Iverson” (2012)﻿Months before appearing on the coveted 2012 XXL Freshmen cover, alongside names like French Montana, Future and Iggy Azalea, Don Trip dropped this Cool & Dre-produced salute to 11-time NBA All-Star Allen Iverson.</p><p>Interestingly enough, the song was the catalyst for a feud when Don and collaborator Starlito found themselves in a bitter Twitter back and forth with Post Malone five years later.</p><p>It ensued following comments made during an interview with HipHopDX when the duo was asked about the correlation between ”Allen Iverson” and Malone’s breakout ”White Iverson.”Dre f.</p><p>Rick Ross - “Chevy Ridin’ High” (2006)﻿Super-producer Dre (one half of Cool & Dre) first made a splash as an artist back in 2006 alongside Rick Ross for this single, which peaked at No. 54 on Billboard’s Hot 100.</p><p>He didn't release another single until 2018, and it took until 2019 for him to finally release a larger body of work, Family Ties, a collaboration with Fat Joe.Tracey Lee f.</p><p>Pirate & Busta Rhymes - "The After Party (The Theme II)" (1997)﻿How Tracey Lee has slipped through the cracks of Hip Hop’s hindsight will forever remain a mystery.</p><p>This well-aged single, featuring Busta Rhymes, was a bubbling remix to the D-Dot produced original, which spent 32 weeks on Billboard’s Hot 100.</p><p>His debut album Many Facez also contained one of the last original Biggie guest verses to be released.Smilez & Southstar - "Tell Me" (2002)﻿This single was inescapable in the summer of 2002.</p><p>It peaked at No. 28 on Billboard’s Hot 100 and spent 16 weeks on the charts — on top of the video being on no less than twice every hour on the hour.</p><p>Unfortunately for the duo, label issues made their debut LP, Crash The Party, their last.</p><p>Fun fact: they are both now in real estate, and quite successful.Rufus Blaq - "Outta Sight" (1998)﻿The peak of Rufus Blaq’s commercial success, this was the lead single off of his slept-on debut album Credentials, which also had a joint featuring The LOX worth revisiting.</p><p>Adding to the song’s popularity, it appeared on the soundtrack for the film Ride, which starred Malik Yoba, the late John Witherspoon and Sticky Fingaz.Sway & King Tech f.</p><p>RZA, Tech N9ne, Eminem, Xzibit, Kool G Rap, Jayo Felony, Chino XL, KRS-One, Pharoahe Monche - "The Anthem" (1999)﻿Appearing on Sway (host of Sway in the Morning on Shade 45) & King Tech and DJ Revolution’s third collaborative LP This Or That, it’s insane this song seems to have eluded lists of best posse cuts over the years — especially considering some of the matchups never happened again.</p><p>For example, Eminem and almost everyone on the list except Xzibit and Tech N9ne.Cool Breeze f.</p><p>Outkast, Goodie Mob & Witchdoctor - “Watch For The Hook” (1999)﻿The problem with large groups is that sometimes history only seems to shine its light on those that make the most noise.</p><p>In the case of Dungeon Family, Outkast was so huge, and Goodie Mob made such an impact that Cool Breeze got a bit lost in the Hip Hop history shuffle.</p><p>However, it’s impossible (when prompted) not to remember how hard this Organized Noize-produced single indeed was.</p><p>It peaked at No. 73 on the Billboard Hot 100 and also propelled his album East Point's Greatest Hit to No. 23 on the Hot 200.JT Money f.</p><p>Solé - "Who Dat" (1999)﻿This song was a monster.</p><p>Not only did it introduce the world to Solé, who later dropped a pretty successful debut album of her own, but it reached No. 1 on the U.S. Rap chart and No. 5 on the Hot 100.</p><p>His album Pimpin' on Wax even cracked the top 10 on the Hot 200, which was no small feat for Miami MCs in 1999.Rhymefest f.</p><p>Kanye West - "Brand New" (2006)Rhymefest's debut album Blue Collar was a definite sleeper, but it was nonetheless a great body of work.</p><p>This track was a standout — though the tea was that Nick Cannon admittedly wrote a few of Kanye West’s bars on the song.</p><p>Specifically, “We don’t need to stunt / I make black history every day, I don’t need a month.” It wasn’t a surprising revelation, considering Rhymefest himself wrote for Ye in the past.Too $hort f.</p><p>Erick Sermon, MC Breed & Kool Ace - "Buy You Some" (1996)﻿This gem appeared on Too $hort’s 10th album, which was supposed to be his last.</p><p>However, his retirement (like many Hip Hop retirements after his) didn’t last more than a year.</p><p>This song, in particular, has the distinction of having one of Erick Sermon’s hardest verses — ever.Gucci Mane f.</p><p>Young Jeezy - "Icy" (2004)﻿Before the unpleasant drama where Gucci Mane killed one of Jeezy's associates during a home invasion gone wrong, the two t-r-a-p-s-t-ar's both had their first taste of success with this Zaytoven-produced single.Lupe Fiasco f.</p><p>JAY-Z - "Pressure" (2006)﻿When many people think of Lupe Fiasco’s debut album Food & Liquor, they think of the Grammy Award-winning single “Daydreamin’” or the seminal classic “Kick Push.” This JAY-Z featured deep cut — which leaked before the album dropped — seems to take a backseat nowadays.Lord Have Mercy - “Say What Say What” (1998)When talking about voices that stand out in Hip Hop, few can lay claim to a baritone as distinct as that of former Flipmode Squad affiliate Lord Have Mercy.</p><p>This banger was meant to be the lead single from his album Thee Ungodly Hour.</p><p>Unfortunately, he split from the group due to artistic differences with Busta Rhymes and the album subsequently became indefinitely shelved.Purple Ribbon All-Stars - “Kryptonite” (2005)﻿Aside from the lesser-known single “Body Rock,” this stands as the only commercially notable track from the two efforts released by the supergroup (Big Boi, Killer Mike, Sleepy Brown, Konkrete, BlackOwned C-Bone, Rock D and Vonnegutt) via Outkast’s Purple Ribbon Records.</p><p>The group once included Bubba Sparxxx and Fonzworth Bentley in its original iteration as well.Archie Eversole f.</p><p>Bubba Sparxxx - “We Ready” (2002)This electrically charged song still pops up at sporting events and in commercials from time to time.</p><p>However, as far as one-hit wonders go, you’d likely be hard-pressed to immediately answer the “who sang this” question at a local trivia night.Rosco P. Coldchain f.</p><p>Pharrell - “Delinquent” (2003)https://youtu.be/8ZvC_X2pka8This gem stands as one of Roscoe=’s best-known solo singles.</p><p>Unfortunately for the Philly MC, politics kept his long-awaited LP Hazardous Life (set to include production from The Neptunes and DJ Premier) shelved.</p><p>Things got worse in 2008 when he was arrested for a double-murder and incarcerated.I-20 f.</p><p>Ludacris & Bone Crusher - “Break Bread” (2004)﻿This Lil Jon-produced banger peaked at No. 45 on Billboard’s US Rap/R&B Singles chart — making it the only single on the Disturbing The Peace member’s debut album Self Explanatory to see any major success.Da Bush Babee f.</p><p>De La Soul & Mos Def - “The Love Song Remix” (1996)﻿The original itself is an absolute classic, but this remix took it to a whole other level by adding 1996-era De La Soul, fresh off of their Stakes Is High LP.</p><p>There is something else special about this track, which appeared on the group’s sophomore LP Gravity.</p><p>In essence, it serves as one of the first recorded appearances of Yasiin Bey, formally known as Mos Def (who appeared on three tracks on the album).Amil f.</p><p>Memphis Bleek, Beanie Sigel & JAY-Z - “4 Da Fam” (2000)﻿Fans definitely didn’t flock to the store to cop Amil’s music, but the commercial blip that was her debut did produce this gem of a track.</p><p>Beyond featuring prime Bleek and Sigel, it has one of Hov’s more slept on verses.</p><p>Had Twitter existed in 2000, the revelation that he was expecting a child likely would have been a New Release Friday trending topic.</p></div>
