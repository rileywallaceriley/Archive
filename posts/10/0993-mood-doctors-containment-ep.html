  <h1>Mood Doctors  – Containment</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>The Mood Doctors, more commonly known as The MD's, are a Long Island based hip-hop group that consists of Lucious "Luck" Mercer, Neal "Purp" Forrester, Savander "Van" Parker a.k.a.</p><p>Grippy Grip and DJ Evil Dee – one half of the Beatminerz and 1/3 of the legendary NYC group Black Moon.</p><p>The group's founding members, Bronx-born Luck (who is the brother of De La Soul member Posdnous) and Jamaican born Purp, are life long friends.</p><p>Together they have over 20 years in the game – and listening to their latest EP, <em>Containment</em>, it definitely shows.

<blockquote>"Just because you wrote a song, don't make it a record, no disrespect kid, tighten up your crew and get connected..."<br> – from the song <em>Refuse</em></blockquote>

The album is both reflective of the NYC underground sound, and collective industry experience – both of which are prominently displayed throughout the entire 6 song project.</p><p>The MDs flip through different styles like the boom bap sounds of the self-produced tracks <em>Refuse</em> (currently getting burn on Beatminerz Radio) and <em>Time Refill</em>, which tackle topics ranging from the industry and NYC life to social/political issues.</p><p>The project is light on features, in fact there is only two: Likwuid knocking <em>Take Me To The Mardi Gras</em> sampled <em>Ayo A Yo</em> and Marlem on the slower neo-soul-vibed bonus joint <em>Thirsty</em>.

Although there is no direct Beatminerz production on this album, Evil Dee provides all the cuts, and a cohesive mix of the entire EP.</p><p>He’s the man behind the iconic <em>How Many MC’s</em> cuts – so you know he comes correct.</p><p>The album is refreshing – but it’s not for everyone, and not for the radio.</p><p>It’s for real heads, and it’s disappointing to know that projects of this caliber may never get the mainstream attention they deserve.</p><p>That’s not the fault of the artist, or even necessarily the listeners; however, that’s a whole other topic.</p><p>It’s a great listen though, and I highly recommend it.</p></div>
