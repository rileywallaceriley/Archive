  <h1>#IndieSpotlight: Lew Sid</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Virginia Beach-native Lew Sid (pronounced Lucid) is back on the scene with a big record, "Big Leagues." The hip-hop turned career rhymer first made  noise in his home state and beyond with the regional smash "Whole Squad," which garnered club and radio play, love on World Star Hip-Hop, and even had spins during Portland Trailblazers home games.</p><p>That's pretty big look -- just saying.</p><p>Refusing to let the dust settle on the momentum he built with the last record, "Big Leagues" is anthemic, heavy, and palpably aggressive.</p><p>With the right video treatment, it feels like the type of record that an athlete would jam while getting ready for a life changing match, fight, or game.</p><p>In fact, he has a stack of dope tracks currently floating around.</p><p>We're officially putting him on our watch list!</p><p>Check the track below, and catch up by watching his visual for "Whole Squad," and some other choice cuts we're feeling here at AAHH.
