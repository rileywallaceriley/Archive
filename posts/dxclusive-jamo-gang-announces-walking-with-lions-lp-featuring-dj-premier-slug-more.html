    <h1>#DXCLUSIVE: Jamo Gang Announces ’Walking With Lions’ LP Featuring DJ Premier, Slug & More</h1>
    <div class="meta">2020-03-11 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>The trio of West Coast Hip Hop vet Ras Kass, seasoned New York MC El Gant and producer J57 — collectively known as Jamo Gang— have announced their forthcoming album Walking With Lions, the official follow-up to their 2018 self-titled debut EP.https://youtu.be/5SGjhI6s09kThe 12-song project includes last year’s "Francis Scott Key" single and several guest appearances, including Atmoshere's Slug, Slipknot's Sid Wilson, Psycho Realm's Sick Jacken, Slaine and the illustrious DJ Premier -- who also produces “The 1st Time” (the only song not produced by J57).” There are just no great two MC albums anymore,” Ras Kass tells HipHopDX. “There's a lot of Hip Hop music out there, but it's very contrived and disposable. We are experimental.</p>
<p>We are lo-fi. We are lyrical, retro and avant-garde at the same damn time.”Jamo Gang’s Walking With Lions LP arrives on April 10 and is available for pre-order now via Fat Beats.Check out the Jared Fiorino cover art and tracklist below.1.</p>
