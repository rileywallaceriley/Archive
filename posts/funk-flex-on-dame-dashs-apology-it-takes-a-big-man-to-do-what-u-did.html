    <h1>Funk Flex On Dame Dash’s Apology: “It Takes A Big Man To Do What U Did“</h1>
    <div class="meta">2019-02-12 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Notoriously outspoken Hip Hop mogul Dame Dash shared two videos via Instagram on Monday (February 11) in which he offered apologies to JAY-Z, Lyor Cohen, Steve Stoute, Jim Jones, and former Rocafella partner Kareem “Biggs” Burke.Funk Flex, who recently went back and forth with Dame following his interview on Nick Cannon’s Cannon’s Class, applauded him for being the bigger man.“This is the guy I met mid-nineties,” Flex wrote via Instagram. “I watched this guy build something out of nothing! I’m glad to see that man return!“He didn’t just apologize... he said what bothered him and he misses his friends!</p>
<p>Don’t clown him for it applaud him,” he added, noting that apologizing made Dame a real man.Last month, Flex accused the mogul of stealing Aaliyah from JAY-Z. “Dame did a snake move… tell me I’m lying u piece of shit ... that why the ROC crumbled you was touching Jayz chick (Remember the house in the Hamptons),” he wrote. The situation escalated, with Dame calling on Hot 97 to fire the veteran DJ.“I went hard at u man cause I felt the mogul I REMEMBER was stand up and that energy for a sec was not the guy I remember!” Flex recalled. “Anything u need from me I’m here!”Flex knows something about apologizing; during an interview with Meek Mill on December 3, he—at the urging of Meek—apologized to Drake, noting that he’d be open to having an on-air conversation.</p></div>
