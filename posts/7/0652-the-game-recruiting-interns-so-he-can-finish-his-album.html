  <div class="content"><p>Any young professionals looking to break into the entertainment industry could land the gig of a lifetime with The Game and his team."I’m looking for two new summer interns," the Compton rapper wrote in the caption of a video shared Monday morning (June 11)." one male and one female to help me while I finish my last album -- and also with my day-to-day schedule," he explained. "Must be available 10-12 hours a day, have your own vehicle and one hell of a resume."As he goes on to say in the video, one of the two interns will be chosen to become his personal assistant on an ongoing basis."Be ready to work and come in very humbled, focused and ready to build," he continued, noting that those interested should provide him with a résumé via his DM."I’ll review them personally as fast as I can and holla as soon as I can," he said. "I can promise you, this will be a life-changing experience."The Game says that the extra help will allow him to focus on his next album, which he has described as his last.</p></div>
