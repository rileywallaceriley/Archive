  <h1>Get Money: Let's Cut Quan Some Slack</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I suggest we cut Rich Homie Quan a little slack.</p><p>Did he break your heart yesterday and epically fudge up a performance of "Get Money?" Yes -- but, before he has a chance to  come up with an excuse, let me offer up a theory: Biggie doesn't mean that much to him!</p><p>There.</p><p>I know, it's hard for some of us to stomach -- the idea that perhaps someone doesn't <i>love</i> Biggie Smalls, the king of NYC.</p><p>Consider, though, that Quan is 26 years old; he was 8 when Biggie Smalls was tragically murdered.</p><p>He was also living in the south and was admittedly artistically influenced by artists like Outkast and Jeezy.</p><p>I'm sure Quan is aware of who Biggie is and what he represents to people, but -- understandably -- he hasn't played a very memorable role in his personal experience.</p><p>Listen, if you didn't experience Biggie during his apex, then it's hard to feel the same affinity towards him that  do.</p><p>Timeless is a subjective term.</p><p>This isn't the first time we've seen this -- VH1 has a history of trying to get a new generation of artists to pay homage to artists that don't have any real "role" in their personal relationship with hip-hop .</p><p>They tried this with Lupe when he dropped the ball during a Tribe Called Quest tribute.</p><p>He admittedly hadn't even listened to <i>Midnight Marauders</i> -- luckily  Twitter hadn't reached it's current Super Sayan form yet, so no memes.</p><p>Quan, though, wasn't so lucky.</p><p>It's not an excuse; these artists  were paid to perform, and did terrible jobs at it.</p><p>We can maybe understand why the lyrics may not be emblazoned into their brains, though.</p><p>To the same effect, I don't know every word to "Friends" by Whodini.</p><p>Also, is "Get Money" really one of the essentially "must-know" Biggie verses by casual listeners/fans?</p><p>He <b>may</b> have nailed "Juicy," or "Mo Money Mo Problems," for example.</p><p>Look, this was a terrible idea all around.</p><p>Quan takes an L for not memorizing the words, but VH1 takes a massive L for dressing him like Biggie and expecting it to be <i>ok</i>.</p><p>I get what they were going for, but it didn't work out.</p><p>Maybe next year they'll have Lil' Yachty perform 2Pac's verse from Digital Underground's "Same Song." SMH!</p><p>RIP Biggie.
