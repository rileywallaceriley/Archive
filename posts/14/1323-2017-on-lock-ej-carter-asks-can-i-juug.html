  <h1>2017 On Lock: EJ Carter Asks 'Can I Juug?'</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>We wrote about St.</p><p>Louis rapper EJ Carter <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/ej-carter-bringing-originality-back/">last year when he dropped the visual for "True" off of his electrifying debut album, <i>Notorious</i></a>.</p><p>The album amassed almost 500k plus streams worldwide and helped him to spark the industry's interest in not only his unique brand of music--which is some of the most exciting sounds from the Midwest since Nelly's diamond selling <i>Country Grammar</i>--but his brand, the R$F Voice, as well.</p><p>He was (optically) quite quiet for 2016, opting to connect all the dots, officially signing the artists and producers along with the behind-the-scenes staff members to his label.</p><p>He appeared on some the  records/singles and set the stage for a big 2017.</p><p>Well, the year is off to a great start; his (yeat old) record "On God" picked up steam in a major way, approaching a million views and landing on Spotify's “Discover Weekly” charts.</p><p>As well, his latest single is almost at 500k spins in under a week!</p><p>The song, "Can I Juug?" is about seizing any current opportunity, EJ explained to AAHH. "I'm asking if I can do my thing.</p><p>With everyone showing hate, can I just 'Juug' out here?"

The catchy hook, which drives the record, is clearly winning over audiences—as are his big bars, such "bang hammers like Thor, but I'm low key." Although his production is very contemporary in its  structure, his wordplay coupled with his overall aesthetic and look make his brand very appealing.</p><p>I stand by my earlier statements <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/ej-carter-bringing-originality-back/">written back in 2016</a>--EJ is bringing back originality.</p><p>At his current trajectory, it's hard to imagine that he won't be a name you hear a lot more about over the next 365 days.</p><p>Check out the new single--and "On God"--below.</p><p>If you haven't already, add EJ Carter to your "must-watch" list.
