Downie passed away Wednesday (October 18) from an aggressive and incurable form of brain cancer called glioblastoma.Along with countless others, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Toronto-born rapper Drake shared a tribute to the rocker via his Instagram account."Rest In Peace legend ... you will be forever treasured by this country and missed by the world," he wrote in the caption of the photo.</p>
<p>The image was taken during the May 5 Toronto Raptors playoff loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers when Downie approached Drizzy during half-time.Public Enemy front-man Chuck D also paid respect to Downie on Twitter, which was met with respect and admiration from many Canadian fans.Downie was diagnosed back in 2015 after suffering a seizure. The Tragically Hip then embarked on a final tour, which ended with an epic sold-out final concert in their hometown of Kingston, Ontario."Gord knew this day was coming – his response was to spend this precious time as he always had – making music, making memories and expressing deep gratitude to his family and friends for a life well lived," read an official the statement on the band's website.Embed from Getty ImagesHipHopDX sends condolences to Gord Downie's family, friends and fans.</p></div>
