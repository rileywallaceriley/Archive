    <h1>Despite French Montana's Tweet Max B Was A Summer Jam No-Show</h1>
    <div class="meta">2017-06-12 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Hot 97's annual Summer Jam event was filled with amazing moments in 2017, like DJ Khaled holding young Asahd up like Rafiki holding young Simba for an incredible photo op. There was Remy Ma as well, who brought out the likes of Lady Of Rage, Monie Love, and Queen Latifah before putting Nicki Minaj up on the screen and dropping her vicious "Shether" record.</p>
<p>One moment that fans were anticipating, though, was a miraculous on-stage appearance by the incarcerated wave god Max B. That, sadly, never happened.French Montana's ominous tweet sent everyone into a frenzy and had major outlets speculating on whether Biggavelli would pop up out of nowhere for an epic set eight years in the making.</p>
<p>It didn't happen, though, and without a live stream, fans were left wondering if — and if not, why? Many were rightly skeptical.Oddly, Frenchie and Hot 97 have been completely silent — understandably.</p>
<p>A Summer Jam rep told HipHopDX that they didn’t have any further information on Max B’s appearance.There has been much talk of Max's impending release from prison dating back to a September 2016 plea deal, which would allow him to be home in two years as a best case scenario, and six years as a worst case scenario.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgCSAPg_-cYIt's most likely fans knew the Summer Jam appearance wasn't going to happen — even if French had some insight to suggest it might. Fans have been treated to unbelievable performances before.</p>
<p>Like the 2Pac hologram, who performed alongside Snoop at 2012 Coachella. Another great example was when the late ODB surprised fans at a Wu-Tang show at Hammerstein Ballroom while on the run from police. "I can't stay on the stage too long tonight - the cops is after me," he told the audience.Summer Jam has given us some incredible moments in Hip Hop history, and fans were hoping this would have been one of them.</p>
<p>Best case scenario, though, perhaps we'll see the wave god at Summer Jam 2019.https://youtu.be/bZ8uBi4oRvc?t=42s</p></div>
