    <h1>Azealia Banks Camps Out At Elon Musk’s House — & Twitter Loves It</h1>
    <div class="meta">2018-08-13 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>According to an Instagram story posted by the ever controversial Azealia Banks, she spent the weekend alone in Elon Musk’s $17 million Bel Air mansion waiting for his girlfriend Grimes to show up for a recording session.“Literally been sitting at Elon Musk’s house alone for days waiting for Grimes to show up and start these sessions,” she wrote on IG. “I have no idea when she is coming back. I’m going to wait one more day then I’m going to go home.”The two were set to collaborate on a song for her scrapped-in-favor-of-dick project, Fantasea II: The Second Wave.</p>
<p>Back in July, she noted that the collaboration was one of the last loose ends holding the project back. Additional screenshots showing deleted stories allegedly posted by Banks suggest that Grimes spent the weekend nursing Musk through an acid trip.</p>
<p>Additionally, Banks seems to note that after ghosting her, Grimes attempted to book her a flight home.The additional posts seem to suggest that she was invited, dispelling the hilarious idea that she pulled up and broke in to take her feature by any means necessary.Whether or not Banks is still at Musk’s house isn’t immediately clear, and nobody from either camp has yet to confirm anything suggested in the deleted posts — though they certainly appear on brand.Nonetheless, Twitter has fallen in love with the story.[apple_news_ad type="standard"]</p></div>
