  <h1>Ghostface x BADBADNOTGOOD – Sour Soul</h1>

<p class="p1">This album has absolutely no filler – and flows coherently from cover to cover.</p><p>It's intricate, down to the last detail, atmospheric and full of depth.</p>

<p class="p1">There's something to be said for live instrumentation, or rather, using actual musicians to record live music.</p><p>It's a practice that was often reserved for (some) live performances and platforms like SNL and Jimmy Fallon; however, with exception of a few groups, namely The Roots, there has historically been a severe lack of Hip-Hop bands.</p><p>It's actually perplexing, when you stop to consider the amount of live instrumentation that has actually gone into the work of some of the most iconic producers of our day.</p><p>That's beginning to change though, and over the past few years there has been a rise in live hip-hop.</p><p>Some notable collborations that I personally enjoyed were <a href=" and Will Sessions</a>, and <a href=" and The Revelations</a>.</p><p>Today though, I have a new favourite.</p><p>Ghostface Killah and GOODGOODNOTBAD have unleashed their jazzy new project <em>Sour Soul</em> on the people – and it's marvellous.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Argue that Ghostface Killah isn't one one of the hardest working cats in the game today.</p><p>Pro tip: you can't.</p><p>Fresh off of <em>36 seasons</em>, which was one of my <a title="Special’s Top 5 of 2014: #4 Ghostface Killah" href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/specials-top-5-2014-4-ghostface-killah/">favourite albums of 2014</a>, the great Ghostini is back in effect, this time collaborating with Toronto-based hip-hop/jazz outfit BADBADNOTGOOD (BBNG).</p><p>If you're not familiar with that name, <a href=" class="s2">they’ve collaborated with Tyler, The Creator</span></a> on multiple occasions, opened for <a href=" class="s2">Roy Ayers</span></a>, and backed <a href=" class="s2">Frank Ocean</span></a> at the 2012 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival as band-in-residence.</p><p>They've also produced for Earl Sweatshirt and Danny Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This album is first, and foremost, a true collaboration.</p><p>It's just as much a showcase of the trio's musical ability as it is a showcase of Ghostface's infinite potential to drop bars, on bars, on bars (and so on).</p><p>In fact, GFK even sits a few of the tracks out, letting the guys shine.</p><p>Tracks like <em>Mono</em>, <em>Stark's Reality</em> and <em>Experience</em> add mood and character to the album, as do extra long outros and transitions. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are a few guest 16's on this album, including Elzhi on the heavy hitting <em>Gunshowers</em>, Danny Brown on <em>Six Degrees,</em> and the ever elusive – and always dope – MF Doom on <em>Raygun</em>.</p><p>A standout for me was the <a href=" Willie</a>-tinged <em>Street Knowledge</em> featuring Tree. </span>This album has absolutely no filler – and flows coherently from cover to cover.</p><p>It's intricate, down to the last detail, atmospheric and full of depth.</p><p>Ghostface gives the listener jewels that range from the overbearing nature of the alphabet boys on <em>Sour Soul,</em> to some overwhelming positivity on the aptly titled <em>Nuggets Of Wisdom</em>.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This album is a breath of fresh air, and is sure to inspire many MC's to work with live musicians for their next project.</p><p>Oh and if anyone in the game STILL isn't up on BBNG, they are about to be – in a major way.</span></p>
