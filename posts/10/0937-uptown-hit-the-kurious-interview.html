<strong>How did you first get involved in hip-hop?</strong>

I first got involved with hip hop as a fan when I was 9yrs. old.</p><p>I grew up on 97th and amsterdam in the height of break dance and graf, across the street from rocksteady park.

<strong>How did you originally get linked up with Bobbitto and Pete Nice?</strong>

I grew up in the same building as Bobbito and he worked at Def Jam and got me a little gig when i finished high school and introduced me to Pete Nice.

<strong>Your first album was a classic…period!</p><p>It was released on Columbia at the same time as Illmatic (I remember seeing the double ads in the source).</p><p>Can you talk a bit about this period?</p><p>On a personal level did you feel any competition with Nas?</strong>

It was an interesting period and everything was moving fast, I was a kid and very immature but having a lot of fun.</p><p>I never felt a drop of competition with Nas, me and my friends admired what he was doing and I was just doing what came natural to me.</p><p>Nas was always cool,really smart and beyond his years.

<strong>What was the process like recording your album?</p><p>Who did you work with?</p><p>What was your personal fave cut?</strong>

That album was a big party.</p><p>Every session was flooded with homeboys and a lot of intoxicants.</p><p>I worked with Stimulated Dummies, Beatnuts, Bosco Money and Pete Nice and Richie Rich.</p><p>I guess my favorite song was I’m Kurious maybe but I really don’t like listening to it (the album) much.</p><p>I think I was in a  place of mass turmoil but having genuine fun in those days but I wish I was capable of taking things more seriously.</p><p>I’m glad that some folks consider it a classic though.

<strong>Do you consider it a classic</strong>?</p><p>I personally may not consider it classic but it definitely has a charm and that’s not up to me to decide anyway.</p><p>I am really grateful for how that album affected certain people and I see the sincerity when they approach me.

<strong>Tough question…but many consider you a pioneer or legend.</p><p>How do you  feel about that?</p><p>Do consider yourself a pioneer?</strong>

I’m definitely a veteran but my path has been long and unpredictable.</p><p>I am a musical artist of some sort that loves hip hop.</p><p>I think I may be a legend probably in my own mind .

<strong>What kept you from releasing a follow-up until 2009?</strong>

I had to find myself and it took a while.</p><p>I’m still learning but I was like yo I gotta release an album, it was haunting me.</p><p>I had some guest spots here and there and some songs but thats it.</p><p>I wasnt believing in myself enough or I was over thinking.</p><p>You CANT overthink music.</p><p>You are WAY better off underthinking.

<strong>Tell us what it’s like working with Doom.</p><p>What is that creative process like?</strong>

Working with DOOM is great.</p><p>He is a true artist.</p><p>Down to earth, unnaffected and loves music but more importantly than that, we were great friends.</p><p>The creative process with Doom is a sloppy perfection if you ask me.</p><p>Smart dude and a kind dude, he’s special.</p><p>He would make raw beats that always lean the right way and breathe and he always kept a notebook with him.</p><p>During times when I was uninspired  he would give me a spark.</p><p>When we get together shit happens and when making hip hop there’s strict rules and theres no rules at the same time.</p><p>That's how we get down.
