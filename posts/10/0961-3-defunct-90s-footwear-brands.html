  <h1>3 Defunct 90's Hip-Hop Footwear Brands</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Many purists (including myself) describe hip-hop as a culture – one full of prominent (era and regionally specific) slang, dances and fashion elements that almost serve(d) as a dress code, for lack of a better term.</p><p>When hip-hop was in it's commercial infancy, there were a number of iconic footwear must-haves that defined a generation and made a mint along the way.</p><p>Unfortunately, they weren't all J's, Air Force Ones and Adidas shelltoe sneakers.</p><p>Many brands who were on top dropped like a bag of bricks – and a few of them for obscure reasons.</p><p>We revisit a couple of them after the jump.</p><p>We also found some great <a href="https://www.naturerated.com/best-ice-fishing-boots/">ice fishing boots</a> for the outdoor enthusiast.

<strong>British Knights</strong>

British Knights were so dope!</p><p>Endorsed by athletes like Dominique Wilkins, they appeared in high profile hip-hop videos and even had commercials with Hammer.</p><p>They had a great run!</p><p>So why did they taper off in popularity?</p><p>In the early 1990s the Crips street gang wore the shoes and took the “BK” logo to indicate “Blood Killer” (allegedly).</p><p>This led to many schools and universities banning the shoes from being worn – a huge blow.</p><p>This, along with the changing landscape and fickle nature of the hip hop culture all contributed to the brand's demise.</p><p>BK’s made a comeback back in 2008, and you can still cop releases of the classic sneaks online and in fine sneaker retailers on your block.

<strong>Troop Sport</strong>

<a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_1761.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-684" src="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_1761.jpg" alt="IMG_1761.JPG" width="100%" /></a>

Troop Sport was a go-to urban brand in the 80’s – the were worn by the likes of LL Cool J, and 3rd Bass.</p><p>They were doing well until an ugly rumor began to surface.</p><p>It was said that the Ku Klux Klan owned the company and that ‘Troop’ was actually an acronym for ‘To Rule Over Oppressed People’.</p><p>It was also said that if you cut open the lining of a jacket, a message read; “Thank you ni**er for making us rich”.</p><p>Claims were made that coded messages were also integrated into the tread of their sneakers.</p><p>Sounds stupid right?</p><p>For a young company whose main market was African American and Latino youth, these accusations were particularly devastating.</p><p>It didn’t seem to matter that the company’s founders were not "white" themselves - they were Jewish and Korean.</p><p>With sales virtually, non-existant, the company eventually went bankrupt. <em>Of course</em> the rumors weren’t true.</p><p>Last we heard, rapper Nelly was reviving the brand.

<strong>Ewing Athletics</strong>

For most of the 1988-89 season, Parrick Ewing wore an unbranded white shoe –toward the end of the season, Ewing, in partnership with Pony founder Roberto Mueller, unveiled the Ewing Athletics brand.</p><p>They made approximately $100 million that year.</p><p>The iconic 33 Hi sneaker was worn by anyone who was <em>anyone</em> at the time.</p><p>The company released over 20 sneakers before folding in 1996.</p><p>Reasons for the closure included the changing marketplace, which saw the rise of sneaker alternatives such as the Timbaland Boot.</p><p>The company was relaunched in 2008 and the sneakers are available at select retailers.
