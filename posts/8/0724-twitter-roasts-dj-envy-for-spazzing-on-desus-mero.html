  <div class="content"><p>Comedy duo Desus Nice and The Kid Mero got a little more than they bargained for when they stopped by The Breakfast Club Thursday morning (March 15) for an interview.</p><p>It took only minutes for host DJ Envy to press the duo about what he perceived to be disrespectful comments about his wife made on their VICELAND show, Desus & Mero."It's not a joke when you're talking about my wife," Envy stated. hostility stemmed from a joke made about Envy and his wife Gia Casey's February 14 appearance on BET's The Real, where they opened up about Envy's infidelity."You knew them DJ Envy checks, though," Desus joked after Gia noted in a clip that she didn't know DJ Envy, but rather Raashaun (Envy's real name).After a couple of minutes of a heated exchange, the duo offered multiple apologies. "Envy, we'll never do another joke about you," Mero said before asking, "You really thought that was disrespectful?""My wife heard it and thought it was disrespectful," Envy replied.Once the situation seemed to die down, Envy proceeded to walk out of the interview at around the 5:50 mark.</p><p>Charlemagne quickly told the cameraman, "Please put the camera on Envy's chair ... that nigga is light skinned.""He pressed us.</p><p>We apologized ... it should be over," Desus said about Envy's exit.Naturally, Hip Hop Twitter has been out in full force roasting Envy.Check out some of the best reactions below and catch the full interview above.</p></div>
