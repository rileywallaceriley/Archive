Singer and producer Calev has a lot going for him; I got into his music quite recently.</p><p>It was after hearing a track he produced, "<a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/aaron-cohen-shows-love-to-50-cent-on-queen/">Queen$</a>" — by Aaron Cohen.</p><p>From there I dove into his catalogue that includes tracks for Emilio Rojas and Dizzy Wright.</p><p>What I found most impressive, though, were his singles.</p><p>To date, he's dropped four which seem to be resonating with all the right people.</p><p>I reached out to Calev on Twitter, and he took some time out chat about his beats, his rhymes, and his life.</p><p>Check out the interview below.

<b>How did you get into music?</b>

My adopted father was a musician.</p><p>He played guitar and sang, and was pretty successful actually.</p><p>He was able to travel all over the world performing and growing up around that; I found a love for music at a young age.

<b>Who are your influences?</b>

My dad, Pharell, Prince, Bob Dylan, Outkast (I'm probably the biggest Andre 3000 fan in the world) Lupe, Jay, etc.</p><p>There's a lot of non-hip hop influences, and hardly any newer hip-hop artists impress or inspire me at all.</p><p>It sounds like an old man thing to say, but I'm 24, and I just have the expectation that music should make you feel something.</p><p>I guess it's something that not a lot of rappers these days are capable of doing.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, there are rappers who do that, but when empty viral content is being pushed by the media for profit's sake, those artists are somewhat ignored.

<b>Would you consider yourself a producer first, or an artist?</b>

Honestly, I just love making music; I don't categorize myself as either.</p><p>I think that there are some things that I can't express in a song, or rap, that I can through music, but it goes both ways.</p><p>I just create whatever it is that I'm feeling at the moment.</p><p>If it comes out as a beat that's great if it's a song, even better.</p><p>That seems like a bit of a cliche answer, but I just make music to express, people just happen to feel it, I guess.

<b>What came first?</p><p>What sparked the transition?</b>

I started producing initially.</p><p>I think I was like 13 or 14 at the time.</p><p>I was in a foster home, and we had gone to Barnes &amp; Noble or something, and they had a Computer Music magazine that came with a demo of Ableton Live (a super early version), and I started trying to make beats on there.</p><p>I played guitar, drums, piano, and violin as a kid, and so having that knowledge of music, and experience helped me a lot when it came to producing.</p><p>In the last year or so, I was blessed to get quite a few placement with artists that I like, as people and as artists.</p><p>I guess that just making those connections, seeing their passion for what they're doing, and the fact that they liked the ideas I had come up with made me want to start working on my music as well.</p><p>I think a huge moment was when Just Blaze tweeted a song that I helped produce, to me that validated what I had been working on, and motivated me to keep going with it.

<b>What can you tell me about the three singles you've dropped so far--is there an album coming?</b>

The first two singles were meant to showcase my mainstream appeal.</p><p>To just show that I can make those types of records, or make songs that your average rap fan in 2017 would want to hear.</p><p>With that being said, that is not the type of rap that I want to be known for at all.</p><p>I think it's empty; it doesn't serve a purpose other than to be entertaining.</p><p>I have a story that I want to tell, as well as shed light on all the places that I have seen us as a people, and as a society, have gone wrong — or places where we have lost our way.</p><p>That brings us to "Feel Good," which touches on some of those topics, even if at a just below the surface level.</p><p>I plan to delve deeper into those subject as the releases continue.</p><p>If I dropped them all at once, I think it might be a little too heavy to for the average listener.</p><p>As far as an album, I think I just want to put out singles and videos for a while before announcing anything like that.</p><p>I was periscoping the other day and played about 50 songs for the people on there.</p><p>I have enough material for a few albums, but I would rather continue the momentum by dropping weekly singles.

<b>You've produced for the likes of Aaron Cohen, Dizzy Wright, Emilio Rojas, JayIDK and more.</p><p>Who else have you produced for?</p><p>Any crazy placements coming up?</b>

My first placement was a Fred The Godson record.</p><p>I think it was a feature actually like he had done a feature for someone on my beat.</p><p>That was probably in 2015.</p><p>I think the next one was "Eat Your Heart Out" by OnCue, that was the record that Just Blaze was feeling a lot.</p><p>Then I connected with Emilio and sent some records back and forth; his work ethic is crazy.</p><p>I would send a folder of beats, and he'd hit me back later that night or the next day with tons of song ideas.</p><p>He and I have been working a lot lately.</p><p>He did a 30 for 30 challenge, dropping a freestyle video every day for 30 days and about half of the beat were made by me.</p><p>We also have a couple of full-length songs that we are working on as well.</p><p>As far as future placements, it's hard to tell, because sometimes an artist will say that they need a certain beat, and then not use it for a year, or 6 months or whatever.</p><p>Makonnen has a few, Roy Woods I think, Mark Battles, Cartier Dave (Two-9).</p><p>There's a lot honestly.</p><p>I don't want just to name drop, but there are some cool sounds being created with some truly talented people.

<b>You seem to be leveraging your clients, featuring them on your singles.</p><p>Can we look forward to a feature for Aaron Cohen or Dizzy Wright?</b>

I mean we just have a mutual respect for each other's talents and our art, and so we can collaborate in different forms.</p><p>I do have a record with both of those guys though, and some of the other artists I'm producing for as well.

<b>Who do you think has next in the game?</b>

J.I.D, Bas, Sylvan Lacue, Kyle, my brother Lance Valley, is the most talented human being I have ever met, and he has a lot of amazing music coming out soon, that I'm helping produce.</p><p>There's a lot of people that I think will see new success this year, but those are just a few of the people that I've been listening to lately.</p><p>There are way too many people to list, though.</p></div>
