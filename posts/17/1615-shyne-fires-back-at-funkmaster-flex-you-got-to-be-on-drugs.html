<p>"Got to be on drugs.</p><p>You got to be on some type of medication, because everybody in New York knows what happened," Shyne said, responding to Flex's tirade.</p><p>During his radio segment, Flex had called Shyne "a stone cold faced liar" and challenged his credibility: "You got no guts.</p><p>You went to jail because you took out your gun 'cuz you were scared to get punched in the face by some dudes that you knew."</p>

<p>Shyne, who served nearly nine years in prison following the infamous 1999 Club New York shooting, pointed to contemporary accounts supporting his account. "Nas said it in his rap, 'I don't like the way Diddy did Shyne with different lawyers.' I didn't ask Nas to say that," he stated, adding that numerous magazine covers and industry figures backed his statements at the time.</p>

<p>The former rapper, now a politician in Belize, countered Flex's accusations about adopting a persona, revealing he had been shot before meeting Diddy. "I was in the crib with a shotgun because I had already been shot… I come from Church Avenue, East 18th, Flatbush, Little Haiti.</p><p>I don't come from suburbia trying to pretend."</p>

<p>Shyne disclosed that a shooting at Bad Boy's Daddy's House studio preceded the Club New York incident by 30 days, which influenced his decision to carry a weapon. "That's when I started carrying a weapon because I had to keep going to the studio and I didn't have any security guards," he explained.</p>

<p>Regarding Flex's promised critique of his Hulu documentary, where the DJ stated, "I'm going to wait till your whack ass documentary come out and I'm going destroy you," Shyne remained unbothered: "That's promotion… He's encouraging everybody to watch it.</p><p>When he goes and watches it and comes back again, that's more promotion for me."</p>

<p>The documentary, which details Shyne's journey from rapper to politician, has reignited discussions about his controversial departure from Bad Boy Records and the events that led to his incarceration.</p>
