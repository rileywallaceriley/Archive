  <div class="content"><p>Fans of Memphis rap legend Juicy J were pleasantly surprised to see his memorable song "Slob On My Knob" trending on Apple Music on Sunday (September 10).The record was a staple of Juicy J's mixtape days but got a wider release on the 1999 album CrazyNDaLazDayz, the sole LP by Three 6 Mafia spin-off group Tear Da Club Up Thugs.</p><p>Although the track wasn't a chart-topping hit, it became a cult classic.“That was a song I wrote when I was in 11th grade," Juicy J told Complex in 2011. "I was in a history class with this dude named Papa Owens, at North Side High School.""Every time I perform, whether it's Japan, Italy -- wherever -- I have to perform that track," he told Vibe Magazine in 2014. "They know it, word for word."Fans on Twitter shared their collective excitement -- and surprise -- about the classic song's resurgence.</p><p>Here's a sample of the reaction below.The sharp rise in the song's popularity over the last 24-48 hours might be attributed to DJ Tommy Madera.</p><p>The Florida-based DJ posted the following video showing a transition between the song and A$AP Ferg's "Plain Jane," which pays homage to the classic, borrowing flows and even reworks some of the bars. not as prevalent a reason but still worth noting is Genius, who pointed out that G-Eazy also borrowed some game from Juicy J, reworking "Slob On My Knob" bars on his new single "No Limit" from the upcoming album The Beautiful & Damned. matter what the catalyst was, the song is back in rotation.</p><p>If you haven't heard it in a while or never even knew it existed before now, give it a spin.</p></div>
