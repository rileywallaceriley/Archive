  <h1>#DXCLUSIVE: Koncept & David Faustino Flip “Boogie Nights” For "Sheeesh" Video</h1>
  <div class="meta">2019-07-19 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Fresh off of the release of “Champagne,” Koncept has officially dropped a hilarious new visual for “Sheeesh,” the latest single from his upcoming LP Champagne Konny.The video stars David Faustino (best known for portraying Bud Bundy on the 90s television show Married With Children), as an interpretation of Dirk Diggler — infamously played by Mark Whalberg in the movie Boogie Nights.https://youtu.be/Nd08dGY7KdgThe video begins with their take on the "pool shoot" scene, where (in the film) an argument between Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) and Dirk results in the porn actor being fired.</p><p>In this case, it leads Koncept to be recast in this role.Much like his previous video, “Sheeesh” sees Kon living his best life — a beautiful pool, women, and the right amount of cheesiness to keep the mood light.Check out Koncept’s “Sheeesh” video above.</p><p>Champagne Konny releases on all major music platforms on August 16th.</p></div>
