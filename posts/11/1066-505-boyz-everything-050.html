  <h1>505 Boyz – Everything 050</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I have to admit, as I sat down to write this, I contemplated opening up with a straight out Jersey meme, but thought that may come off a little too cliché.</p><p>Granted, it would have been fine if I had reviewed this album when it first came across my desk.</p><p>I admit it, in a sea of releases over the past few months, I completely slept on <i>Everything 050</i>, by the Jersey natives, 050 Boyz – a trio consisting of Prince AK, Tru Trilla and Riq da Kid.</p><p>I get a lot of promos in my inbox, and for some reason this one just didn't jump out at me.</p><p>I dropped the ball.</p><p>Having given this project a few listens, I can definitely co-sign these guys.</p><p>Here's why:

<b>They are co-signed by legends</b>

The group has deep roots and connections in Jersey; however, as a "group" of sorts, they first worked together as part of the (shelved) super-group Garden State Greats.</p><p>The failed group was the brain child of Naughty by Nature frontman Treach.</p><p>As the 050 Boyz, a group whose ideology is based on the original Garden State Greats concept, they've been guided by DoItAll, one 1/3 of the Lord of the Underground.</p><p>Now, not sure about you, but Naughty and Lords are definitely in my top 25 groups ever – in fact, The Lord's Keepers of the Funk was one of my fave albums growing up.</p><p>I know co-signs aren't everything, but having someone who helped shape your love of the culture put their stamp on something should make it an auto-cop.

<b>They are consistent with their production</b>

I've said it a million times, I'm a sucker for single producer album.</p><p>This project was produced entirely by Clinton Place who have it's boom-bap charm.</p><p>This direction keeps the project sounding cohesive, rather than a series of loosies.

<b>They don't take chances – in a good way</b>

This album fails to really break any creative ground, but that's not a bad thing.</p><p>Rather than try to fit themselves into any contrived roles, they just drop bars with a golden era aesthetic – and obvious street logic and sensibility.</p><p>Sonically, the group have great chemistry.</p><p>They almost put me in mind of State Property (only slightly).</p><p>From the album opener <i>Hot Damn</i>, the posse cut <i>Concrete Combat </i>– which features the hottest Onyx sample ever – to the introspective <i>What Happened</i>, they sound like vets; although, they still have a spark in their overall demeaneor.</p><p>Standouts for me were also the Treach assisted <i>DNA</i>, and DoItAll assisted <i>Pay Them No Mind</i>.</p><p>The album is definitely worth a spin.</p><p>I'll definitely keep my eye on these guys.
