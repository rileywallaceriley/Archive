  <h1>Bobby J & Daru Jones Deliver A Back To The Basics Banger With 'One Mic & Drum'</h1>

<p>Bobby J is somebody I've been vocal about for a while now; he always delivers, in my opinion.</p><p>He had hit a high note with last year's <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/70ZVZgHGoN4LoR8bjqbBAM?si=fVJrSWRaS2O1VXfUOgf9tA">Summer Classics</a></em> — primarily produced by industry legend Kwamé.</p><p>Then he dropped the unexpected gem that was the Statik Selektah-produced <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6QxR3ZtYJ3g7pNEXe0npqv?si=KJoBtxmsTHSskqQZQpFglA">Endless Summer </a></em>EP.</p>

<p>But this new one, <em>One Mic &amp; Drum</em> with <a href="https://www.rusicrecords.com/">Daru Jones,</a> is something special.</p>

<p>Off the rip, his wordplay is crazy. "Mouthpiece" is one that caught more than a few rewinds while I was going through the LP.</p><p>Same with "Lullaby," which was easily my fav joint on the 18-shot affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daru, for those without context, has earned the acclaim of go-to Hip Hop drummer over the years.</p><p>He's worked with a (long) list of who's who in the game — from Pete Rock and Talib Kweli to Ski Beatz and Salaam Remi.</p><p>Most notably, he won a Grammy in 2015, working with Jack White.</p><p>As far as drummers go, Daru Jones is upper echelon.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What's most intriguing about the project is the range of vibes Daru and Bobby can collectively deliver, while stripping things down to their rawest elements.</p><p>Kind of like innovating by dominating with the basics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A great example is their tribute to Gang Starr's "Take It Personal," with Gabriela Riley's nuanced vocal stabs buttering the beat while Bobby floats along.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's a specific vibe that isn't built for every situation; that could keep this one in more solid rotation with the "real head" crowd instead of fans of more mainstream sounds.</p><p>But that's the point.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those with a refined taste for real Hip Hop at its purest, Bobby J and Daru have crafted a delightful slice of "for the culture" type vibes.</p><p>If you see this on vinyl, snap it up!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Verdict: Recommended experience<br>Vibe: Spin the vinyl and zone<br>Top 3: "Lullaby," "Mouthpiece," "Look At What I Become"</strong></p>
