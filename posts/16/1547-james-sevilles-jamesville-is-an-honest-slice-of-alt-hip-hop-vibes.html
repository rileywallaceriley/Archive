  <h1>James Seville's Jamesville Is An Honest Slice Of Alt-Hip-Hop Vibes</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Having first got onto New Orleans-born artist James Seville after he dropped his first release via streaming networks, Beta, he's been an exciting artist to watch grow.</p><p>The initial taste of his sound provided a diverse base of alternative Hip Hop potential, and as he's grown, the music has only become more personal, and -- whether intentional or not -- refined.</p><p>His first official release, which comes after a string of one-off singles (which we were here for), <em>Jamesville </em>is an exciting blend of vibes that perfectly encapsulate the new waves blurred lines between bar-centric traditionalism and melody-driven bops.

"I open up a lot and talk about things that have helped me grow throughout the years…losing my dad, dropping out of school, falling in love, falling out of love, drinking, drugs ,” James told N.O.-based <a href="http://www.offbeat.com/news/james-seville/">Off Beat Magazine</a> this past summer. “I like to make music that is genuinely good, and that people of all ages can enjoy.</p><p>Rap music that you and your mom can bump together.”

It's this universality and approachability that makes this latest body of work so enjoyable.</p><p>With his late father being a blues musician, and having grown up engulphed in the iconically jazzy sound of "N'Awlins," James music has this unique approach.</p><p>It's a melting pot of vibes, brimming with emotion -- yet acutely aware of its contemporary appeal.</p><p>This can be seen by contrasting the infectious groove of "The Kids Will Be Fine" with the sure-shot hit-appeal of "Send2Me" -- which will be seeing a visual treatment this month -- and "Margarita" featuring Shvkiel.

The project kicks off with a playful vibe, with "Career Day" -- complete with a skit that put us in mind (spiritually) of Kanye's critically acclaimed debut, College Dropout.</p><p>The tongue-n-cheek- theme of fuck school take your own path isn't religiously adhered to (at least in a straight forward sense), but does carry over in the second song, "School Spirit," which features Ayomari (an artist we've had on our radar for a while now).

<blockquote>“I am inspired by a lot of older New Orleans musicians," he told DNO magazine in an interview. "My mom always took me out of school and brought me to Jazz Fest ever since I can remember ...</p><p>I met Allen Toussaint when I was nine-years-old."</blockquote>

This impending sense of making his dreams a priority is felt on the album, as is this gloss of smokey grooves that make it immediately likable.</p><p>With James recently revealing that he is becoming a father this August, there is feeling that things go in full-circle. <em>Jamesville </em>is an encapsulation of his road up to this point; an excellent opportunity to orient yourself for what he has coming next. "I haven’t stopped smiling since <em>Jamesville </em>came out," James admitted via Instagram. "I hope y’all are enjoying it."
