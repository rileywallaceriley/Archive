  <h1>Pastor Troy Calls Out T.I., Ludacris & Jeezy For Equal ATL King Respect</h1>
  <div class="meta">2019-02-07 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Pastor Troy has called out T.I. for suggesting that Tip, Ludacris and Jeezy were primarily responsible for laying the groundwork for Atlanta's rap scene."These faces along with a host of others (that look like US) laid the foundation for the infrastructure/artistic ecosystem you now know as Atlanta," T.I. wrote. "THIS OUR SH*T & WE RUN THIS CITY," Don’t get it FU*K’d UP!!!</p><p>We’ll adjust the temperature to make it as HOT or COLD as we see fit.</p><p>If we ain’t wit it... it ain’t SH*T!"Troy says he found the suggestion funny since he appeared on the debut albums of all three rappers.</p><p>The veteran MC featured on "Get Off Me" from Ludacris's major label debut Back for the First Time, "GA" from Jeezy's Come Shop Wit Me (technically Jeezy's second LP) and the remix of "I'm Serious" from T.I.'s first LP.“I’m on All 3 of Their FIRST Album...So who am I to This CITY?!!!!” Troy wrote. "I didn’t call nobody to get on they albums, They Peopled Called Me...”Why?” Cause I had this City on Click Clack Lock."He added, "My Biggest Regret in The Rap Game was Fucking With Niggaz that wanted my Spot, Because I Didn’t Have To.</p><p>I needed more Allies to make this ATL Gangsta Rap Scene Stick...So I worked with Everybody."Troy also notes "No More Play in GA," his declaration of war with Master P from his debut LP We Ready (I Declare War), opened up doors for Atlanta's gangsta rap scene."Going At No-Limit Made Our Gangsta Rap Scene In ATL," he wrote. "Don’t EVER get that Shit Twisted!!! “We Ready” with that Phone Call To P, Opened All The Doors For ATL Gangsta Rap Scene Today...Nigga, I stopped the Tank!!!" has yet to respond.</p><p>However, there is a strong possibility that him noting "a host of others (that look like US)" included names like Troy.</p><p>Ironically, he may not have wrote a list in case he accidentally left someone out and offended them, which happened anyway.​</p></div>
