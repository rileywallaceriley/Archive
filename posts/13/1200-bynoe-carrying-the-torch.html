  <h1>Bynoe: Carrying The Torch</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Rapping came easy to Far Rockaway's Bynoe – it was second nature.</p><p>He came up influenced by artists like Mobb Deep, Bob Marley, CNN, 50 Cent, Maroon 5, Biggie, Nas and Mary J Blige; his break in the game came when he began to start working on music with the late Stack Bundles.</p><p>In June of 2002, they created Starting 5 , which was made up of members Stack Bundles, Cau2g$, Mike Millz, Bishop, and Bynoe.</p><p>Two years later, the late Chinx joined the group in 2004 shortly before Mike Millz, and Bishop decided to call it quits.</p><p>Stack signed was to DJ Clue's "Desert Storm" Imprint, which opened a lot of doors for the foursome.</p><p>They recorded with the likes of  Kanye West, Jim Jones, Maino, Lil' Wayne, Tony Yayo, French Montana, and Mobb Deep.</p><p>Also, they also worked with many DJ's such as DJ Clue, Pudgee P, Superstar Jay, Kay Slay and Scoob Doo.</p><p>Unfortunately, Stacks was tragically gunned down in his neighbourhood in 2007, and eight years later, Chinx suffered a similar fate; he was killed in a drive-by shooting after a show in Queens last May.</p><p>Having suffered so much loss, which sandwiched a three-year weapons bid, Bynoe realized that music was/is his savior.</p><p>He's now putting on not just for himself, but his fallen homies.</p><p>He took a few minutes to chat with AAHIPHOP about his new music, his background, and his goals in the industry as a solo artist.</p><p>Check his latest single featuring the late Chinx, and the short Q&amp;A (below).

<b>How did you originally get into hip-hop?</b>

I got involved by listening to artist like Mobb deep and reciting their music and then putting it into my words.</p><p>My older brother was a massive influence because he played music 24/7.

<b>Tell me about your music.</b>

My music is raw and uncut.</p><p>I write from a more aggressive standpoint because of my neighborhood -- but I can write and do any genre of music.</p><p>I feel music has no boundaries depending on the vibe and type of beat; I write with that approach. 

<b>What do you want people to take away from Bynoe, the artist?</b>

I want you to take from me as an artist as I'm just like you; I go through the same struggles, wins, and losses.</p><p>I'm just like any average person, so I want you to see me as YOU -- and to always see the message in my artistry.

<b>Are you aiming for a deal?</b>

I love the independent grind and building from the ground up -- it's like a high for me.</p><p>Rocking small venues, getting in touch with the people; it's more Intimate because I'm all about touching the people.</p><p>I would do the major thing if it's the right situation, and I can expand my brand and agenda further without any boundaries.
