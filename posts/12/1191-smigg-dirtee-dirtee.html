  <h1>Smigg Dirtee -- #Dirtee</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Not to sound all DJ Khaled-ish, but the keys to success in the rap game are a combination of both quality and consistency.</p><p>With over a decade of solid bars under his belt, Sacramento/San Diego's rapper and CEO, Smigg Dirtee, walks the line -- and he has the war stories and strong fan base to prove it.</p><p>His latest project, <em>#Dirtee</em>, is a little bit of everything; but it all adds up to a balanced plate sure to satisfy even the hungriest hip-hop head.</p><p>The album kicks off with a flip of the EPMD classic, "Please Listen to My Demo," where Smigg asserts his lyrical dominance and prepares listeners for the journey ahead; but that's just the appetizer.</p><p>It's the second track, though where things get started.</p><p>It's within the first 16 bars where he drops probably the most telling bars of the album: "Intelligent hood life -- I'm like Chief Keef and Lupe." This sentiment stayed in my head for the bulk of the audio experience.</p><p>He traverses the rawest manifestation of street life on the dope boy anthem "Drug Dealer Paranoia," flashes his certified mack card on the self-titled "Dirtee," and lives up a Chief Keef level of trapness on "IDGAF" and "Stupid Loud." There is also a healthy dose of introspective, down to earth music here, though, like "Special," where he pays homage to those often left out of 'thank you' tracks, like his step-father, and his friend who -- after a string of tragedies -- turned to drugs.</p><p>A stand-out for me was "2 Different Worlds," a modern day Romeo &amp; Juliet-esque story of a love affair with a girl from a more well-off background.

The album closer, "Bout This Life," is the real gem here, as he confidently drops braggadocious raps, while sharing nuggets about himself: "I've been through too much shit to swag rap." As a listener, that's what makes Smigg so relatable, because I've  been through too much shit to <i>listen</i> to swag rap that dominates the airwaves. <em>#Dirtee </em>is, at points, intelligent and ignorant -- see?</p><p>Chief Keef and Lupe.</p><p>It's a well-balanced project that gives listeners glimpses into the ups and downs of an artist who's been doing this since the 90s era.</p><p>A must-listen, in my humble opinion.</p><p>Early.
