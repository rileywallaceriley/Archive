  <h1>The Lord Razu’s “Release” Is Dripping In Dopeness</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sat, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Back as a youngster, my neighbour had gotten a job working as a promotional rep for an College radio station; during his tenure, he often let me hang posters and things of that nature, paying me in promo tapes and records.</p><p>This was during the Def Jux era.</p><p>I fondly remember that as a coming of age period for me, and anything that remotely reminds me of it gets an auto-pass.</p><p>Every once in awhile I come across artists who evoke those memories, without trying too hard — which is corny.</p><p>Luckily I found a great one who’s been on repeat all weekend, The Lord Razu.</p><p>Drawing inspiration from 90s Hip Hop, video games, Kung-Fu flicks, anime (and things of that nature) he sounds like a descended of acts like GP-Wu, Kill Army.</p><p>With a penchant for blending drum and bass elements, this self-produced rapper looks like a chip off of a young El-P’s block.

His new project, Release, is full of bangers.</p><p>Kicking off with the booming “Lyrical Frankenstein,” the project has a timeless sound.</p><p>Immediate highlights were the head nodding “Lurkin’” with its dancehall chorus, and the piano-driven “Backstory.”

He has a relaxed cadence, and range of pen game that traverses a few lanes.</p><p>There are some dope storytelling elements on the Latin-tinged love track “Cupid’s Kunai,” all the way to looser conceptual bar-for-bar gems like the spacey “Outta Time.” The flow on “Family” is crazy; he comes across like a long-lost Wu affiliate.</p><p>Drenched in nostalgia with contemporary touches, and a healthy heap of samurai/ninja-ism, Razu is a gem—more than worth a spin.</p><p>Highly recommend.</p><p>Also, check out the visual treatment for “Lurkin’,” above.</p><p>Early.
