  <h1>Hip-Hop and video games: The Oh No interview</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>It runs in the family.</p><p>It’s often (but not always) surprising when you realize that artists are the products of either musical parents and/or have talent in their families.</p><p>This was true for artists like Prodigy of Mobb Deep, whose grandfather, Budd Johnson and great-uncle Keg Johnson were active in the Bebop era of jazz.</p><p>His mother, Fatima Frances Collins, was also a member of the The Crystals, a group that cracked the Us Top 20 charts in the 60’s – side note, read his book.</p><p>Then there’s Nas, whose father is jazz/blues musician Oli Dara.</p><p>This is also the case with talented producer/artist Oh No – who happens to be both the son of a musician and the younger sibling of Madvillain producer Madlib aka Quasimoto.

He began his career as a rapper, even featuring on wax with his brother’s group Lootpack, but he insists that he, much like his big bro, is a producer first.</p><p>Hard to disagree when you look/listen to his vast catalogue of releases and credits – from solo releases, his album with Chino XL and Roc C to his group Gangrene (with producer Alchemist).</p><p>From working with the late great J.Dilla to scoring the fastest – and highest – selling video game of all time, Oh No has had quite the career up to this point.</p><p>With his latest project Animal Serum (a collaboration with Prince Po) dropping February 4th, I was lucky enough to chat with the cali-based super producer.</p><p>We touched on everything from his music, his love of video games and gambling at <a href="https://casinoenligne-francais.net/lucky31/">https://casinoenligne-francais.net/lucky31/</a> - to getting beat tapes from Dilla, can you even imagine?</p><p>Interview below:

<strong>Did you always know you wanted to be in hip-hop?</strong> I always knew I wanted to do music.</p><p>From the start, when my parents brought equipment in the house, I was all on it.</p><p>My mother use to have this keyboard, and she used to write music.</p><p>My father (Otis Jackson) and brother (MadLib)….man, it’s in my blood.</p><p>Even my kids read and write music.

<strong>You’ve been in both rapper and producer roles in your career.</p><p>Which do you prefer?</strong>

I prefer being the producer first, second and third.</p><p>Being the rapper comes like ninth.</p><p>I like rapping, don’t get me wrong, but when it comes to shows and all the production I do…all the smoke I’m smoking… It’s too hard to try to remember lyrics.</p><p>I have to sit there and listen to the songs over and over to get it right.</p><p>I work on a lot of projects all the time, I’m working on multiple albums each month.</p><p>So I just don’t have the time to really remember each lyric.

<strong>How did you get into the game?</strong>

I first started with my man J Duce .</p><p>I was using my brother’s SP12 making beats, and we started our group called Kali Wild.</p><p>We incorporated Cornbread from the bay and sauna aka Biggs.</p><p>We made a gang of albums. going back and forth from the ox to oakland trying to get our music on my man recordings..</p><p>From there I ended up connecting with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasco">Rasco</a>, he was on <a href="http://www.stonesthrow.com/">Stones Throw</a> at the time.</p><p>He bought a single that we (Biggs and I) did.</p><p>He showed it to Peanut Butter Wolf, and that’s how I ended up getting my deal.

<strong>Tell me about your love for video games.</strong>

Ive always been a crazy game collector since Atari to now with PS4 and all that.</p><p>I’m also really big into PC gaming.</p><p>I love simulators.</p><p>I made a custom arcade that has street fighter to digital pinball on it..</p><p>Pretty much every game on it..</p><p>It’s like a virtual dave and busters over here.

<strong>How did you get into producing music for video games?</strong>

I used to make beats out of video games.</p><p>I would always get my beats placed and one day my man – who was working with Capcom – approached me and said I should make video game beats (specifically for Street Fighter).</p><p>I told him I already had a bunch.</p><p>I sent over something fresh and they loved it.</p><p>They asked who I wanted to work with on it, and I had just gotten Redman’s contact so I said, “how about Redman?” They made that happen.</p><p>Then I started working with Alchemist and he brought Rockstar into the picture.</p><p>He was working on GTA Chinatown Wars, doing the music for the radio station, so I worked with him on that.</p><p>I did drum work for Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare.</p><p>From there Rockstar approached us (Alchemist and I) about working on GTA V and creating and original soundscapes for each scene in the game.</p><p>The rest is history..

<strong>And that’s the highest selling game ever.</p><p>As a serious gamer that must feel great, no?</strong>

Being a big video game collector, its crazy to have that under my belt… definitely a big deal.

<strong>You also score (shows) for Cartoon Network?</strong>

Yeah I do.</p><p>Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, HBO, CBS, Fox.</p><p>I can say the bulk of my time goes to scoring TV shows, commercials, video games and documentaries.</p><p>In fact, I just finished working on a documentary with director David Paul Meyer about a great comedian Trevor Noah called <em>You Laugh But It’s True</em>.

<strong>How did you meet Prince Po?</strong>

I met prince Po about 8 years ago while he was working with Madlib doing a song on the <a href="http://www.stonesthrow.com/perceep">Percee P </a>album (<a href="http://www.stonesthrow.com/store/album/perceep/perseverance">Perserverance</a>).</p><p>I started sending beats and he started calling me and spitting over the phone.</p><p>It was crazy like where have you been?</p><p>Let’s work!</p><p>We were doing songs off and on, just seeing where it took us.</p><p>I was juggling Alchemist projects and Prince Po tracks, on top of scoring, so it took a while to really get this finished.</p><p>But it’s finally coming out.</p><p>It’s all very next level stuff.

<strong>What does the title Animal Serum mean to you?</strong>

For me, I feel like it’s animal blood, you know, drinking the blood of an animal.</p><p>We’re really trying to regenerate that rawness.</p><p>The way he’s coming at it with the lyrics is so intense.</p><p>There’s a LOT of true lyricism, and that’s what we’re bringing back.</p><p>That raw animal essence.
