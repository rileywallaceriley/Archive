Baton Rouge, Louisiana, has risen to notoriety within the fabric of hip-hop—with artists like Boosie and Kevin Gates ascending to superstardom.</p><p>More recently, young upstart NBA YoungBoy has become one of the most promising rappers in the game, further thrusting the region into the spotlight.</p><p>The city is bursting with talent, though; notably, 27-year-old Jay627 is an artist who is out to not only make a name for himself but put his city onto a different lane.

"My sound is different," he says humbly. "I'm trying to separate myself from the rest by creating music with more live instruments—giving it a more authentic feel." It's an organic strategy for the young Emcee, as members of his family are musicians; two of his uncles were honoured within the Louisiana Blues Hall of Fame--so music is quite literally in his blood.</p><p>His influences range from the militant/revolutionary voice of Tupac Shakur, super-producer and Cash Money Records catalyst Mannie Fresh, to Stevie Ray Vaughn and the Gap Band; his eclectic tastes are apparent in his music.</p><p>To date, Jay627 has released numerous mixtapes--his latest being 7 and the follow-up, 7 chapter 2 [both available on DatPiff.</p><p>Currently, he's busy working on a new album, but stresses that he's in no rush. "I'm taking my time so that I get the correct sound; it will be announced soon, though." The two singles, "Stairway Part 2" and "Poor Nigga Blues" are illustrative of the attention to detail that will ultimately carry through the entire project, which is--as of now--untitled.

"My goals in the industry are to spread my music worldwide; create music for all, expand my creativity, and hopefully land a major deal," says Jay with a smile. "I feel like the world is tired of hip hop with trends: one person makes one style of song, and the rest follow.</p><p>I'm trying to stand out and be different." With a hunger that's unreal and a strong support system behind him, Jay627 emerges as an artist to keep on top of your watch list.</p><p>Check out the newest single, "Stairway Part 2," below.
