    <h1>New Book Breaks Down Business Lessons Inspired By Nipsey Hussle</h1>
    <div class="meta">2019-08-25 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Author Ash Cash has distilled several gems based on the professional legacy of the late Nipsey Hussle for his brand new book Hu$$leNomics: Money, Ownership & Business Lessons Inspired by Nipsey Hussle + a Step by Step Guide on How to Implement Each Principle.“Nipsey was on a mission to teach his community about being fiscally responsible and building wealth,” Cash tells HipHopDX of the book.Nipsey’s career was earmarked with brilliant business moves: from selling his 2015 project Mailbox Money for $1000 a copy, generating $60,000 in seed money for other ventures to the thriving success of his Marathon clothing brand.There was also a great deal of community-focused initiatives he launched. One example is Too Big To Fail, a center offering science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) programs to his neighborhood in Crenshaw.“What Nipsey Hussle was teaching us through his music and his actions had the potential to liberate communities around the world,” he adds. “Even though he is no longer with us in the physical, through his music, Interviews — and now this book — his teachings will live forever.”This isn’t the first time Ash Cash has bridged a gap between Hip Hop culture and education.</p>
<p>He previously used JAY-Z’s 4:44 and Kanye West rants as catalysts for well-timed books about wealth management and financial freedom.He notes that paperback copies of Hu$$leNomics will be available soon, with all proceeds to be donated to one of the causes that Nip started.Hu$$leNomics: Money, Ownership & Business Lessons Inspired by Nipsey Hussle + a Step by Step Guide on How to Implement Each Principle is available here.https://youtu.be/AtBsYskFtzs</p></div>
