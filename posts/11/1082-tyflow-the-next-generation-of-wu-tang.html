  <h1>TyFlow: The Next Generation Of Wu-Tang</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>This makes me sound old, by my 'generation', regardless of whatever, will always have a soft spot in our hearts for Wu-Tang Clan.</p><p>They single handedly transformed the concept of what a rap group could be, and gave birth (or prominence) to numerous notable off-shoots, such as: Killarmy, Sons Of Man, American Cream Team, etc.</p><p>It's refreshing to see a <i>new</i> generation of of artists are trying to carry the torch.</p><p>TyFlow is one such artist.</p><p>TyFlow, member (by blood) of the Cuffie Crime Family, is one of the Leaders of the next generation of Wu Tang's " Cream Team." Jerry Pulaski, or North Tech, named him as the 2nd most exciting next gen WuTang artist to watch for.</p><p>He's also a focused boxer – so he's nice with his fists.</p><p>Together with Young Dirty Bastard, Radio Rah , iNTeLL(spelled like that), Justice and Don Staten, TyFlow is helping Wu Tang continue to be "about the children" for a new, younger, core audience.</p><p>Give my man a spin on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tyshawn-jones">Soundcloud</a>, and <i>sound off</i> on our Twitter feed!
