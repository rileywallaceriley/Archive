  <h1>MOP - Street Certified</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>It's big day for NYC street music.</p><p>Another group celebrating 20 years + in the game, the Brownsville, Brooklyn duo MOP, dropped their long awaited new EP <em>Street Certified</em>.</p><p>At 9 songs, it's a solid effort that has some respectable new street-hop and a few pre-leaked standouts (notably the title track featuring Mobb Deep and addictive <em>187</em>).</p><p>If you're a fan, you'll love this album.</p><p>The project has a few guests – Maino joins Billy and Fame on the lead-off <em>Welcome To Brooklyn</em>, and Busta Rhymes on the single <em>Broad Daylight</em>.

<!--more-->

What you have to love/respect about MOP is that they know what they are (and what they aren't).</p><p>They deliver consistent music, and have been doing so since <em>How About Some Hardcore</em>.</p><p>This project is unlikely to build much of a new fan-base as none of the songs have the massive commercial appeal of a song like <em>Ante Up</em>, but we doubt they care.</p><p>This one is for their core – and we're pretty sure they'll be more than happy with this release.
