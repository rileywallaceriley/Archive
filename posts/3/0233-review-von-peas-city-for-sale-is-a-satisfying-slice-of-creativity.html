  <h1>Review: Von Pea’s “City For Sale” Is A Satisfying Slice Of Creativity</h1>
  <div class="meta">2019-09-30 — reviews</div>
  <div class="content"><p>It’s been a great year for fans of Tanya Morgan.</p><p>First, Donwill dropped his Von Pea-produced One Word No Space LP this past summer, and now Pea drops his latest, City For Sale — the follow-up to 2018’s I’m Good Luv, Enjoy.As the vet rapper noted in his Bandcamp liner notes for the project, this is his first body of work produced entirely by himself — adding that he hopes it will ultimately be his “calling card.” That may not be far off; while not a listen that everyone will find fruitful, the 11-song LP is an original, eclectic mix of funky loops and breaks that serve as the backdrop to Pea’s seasoned pen.</p><p>A prominent theme of the LP is the gentrification of the borough of Brooklyn — not unlike the sentiment that courses through the veins of Skyzoo’s latest offering.</p><p>On the soulful opener “Here Come The Neighborhood,” he spends plenty of bars in the second verse describing how his block has changed.</p><p>In fact, this project is in many ways dedicated to Brooklyn, even spouting specific intersections before some of the tracks.</p><p>Though it’s not clear if they are meant to add literal significance to the songs themselves, like the Halsey Ave and Throop Ave tag that precedes “Wild” featuring Donwill.https://youtu.be/HM8fsxrwClEAssuming that it does, it adds further dimension to some of the project’s standouts, like the Gary Bartz sampled-“The Norm,” a stark warning to BK’s newer breed of upscale resident that danger still lurks on a block that has yet to be gentrified (which he notes is Vernon Ave between Lewis and Sumner).He also gives a similar geographical definition to “Around The Way Girl” — Marcus Garvey Ave between Park and Myrtle.</p><p>This song is one of the most endearing as Pea grapples with how to approach his role in the life of a past partner’s son, and his emotions that came with the falling out of that relationship.https://youtu.be/WCRzU9ag9jYThat idea of moving on from a relationship is actually a very pronounced subtext of this entire album.</p><p>Whether it’s relationships with people or the old New York, there is a sense of moving on that subtly interweaves itself throughout. https://youtu.be/bGFqDqtJPZc What makes this project so compelling is its awareness and cohesion.</p><p>Pea’s production isn’t linear by any sense, but then again neither are his rhyme schemes.</p><p>There’s this overarching sense of blue-collared normality to his music. “Pity Party” is a good example, where he describes failure from multiple perspectives.</p><p>This definitely isn’t a project made for casual listeners; a lot of the shiniest gems require you to really sit with an LP that is devoid of much commercial fodder, which does pigeon hole it’s audience a bit.</p><p>Some of his beats also sport this kind of awkward appeal, not unlike MF DOOM.</p><p>City For Sale manages to walk the fine line of (sonically) dated and timeless, though the LP definitely teeters said line throughout its duration.</p><p>For fans of Tanya Morgan and Pea’s previous work, City For Sale is a satisfying slice of creativity.https://youtu.be/ZNKtjEZsf88</p></div>
