  <div class="content"><p>Sex sells and compelling/shocking visuals hold your attention – if you can also get some bars out of it, well that's just a bonus.</p><p>What do I mean by that?</p><p>Remember <em><a href=" Remember Eminem's <a href=" album</a>?</p><p>When it's kind of messed up, but you can't stop consuming it, the artist is doing something right!</p><p>That's how I felt after watching the (Worldstar Hip-Hop) video for The Grey Jones Club's <em>Severed Dick</em>.</p><p>The title alone is click bait – and the video has a total NSFW twist.</p><p>There's also that bonus though, the one I was talking about.</p><p>She has bars, and an entertaining delivery.</p><p>I immediately googled her and checked out her debut mixtape <em>Manic Pixie Dream Whore</em>.</p><p>With buzz happening around the song, and lack of detail about this girl as an artist, I had to find her and interview her.</p><p>Check out our discussion below.

<strong>Introduce yourself and maybe tell me a little about how you got into hip-hop.</strong>

I'm The Grey Jones Club.</p><p>I'm a rapper from Atlanta Georgia.</p><p>I go by The Grey Jones Club because I've got so many styles I feel like I'm a group – and if my personality was a color it would probably be grey.</p><p>I've been writing music since 2010 but <em>Manic Pixie Dream Whore</em> is my first completed project.</p><p>I have the soul of an artist.</p><p>I could've been a painter, a surrealist film director or a fucking mime – but rap music is my chosen medium.</p><p>Growing up in poverty I wasn't exposed to fine arts and theatre and all that shit, so all the great artists I knew of and respected were rappers.</p><p>I always wanted to be like them.

<strong>Who were some of your influences?</strong>

I listen to all types of rappers.</p><p>I grew up on people like Nas, Mos Def, Common, Outkast and Dead Prez.</p><p>You know, the <em>conscious</em> rappers and also the whole <em>neo soul</em> movement.</p><p>Those things influenced my style.</p><p>I'm also  from Atlanta, so I support a lot of the local artists out there.</p><p>I love Atlanta and I love our sound so Jeezy, Gucci – and others – are also really big influences of mine.</p><p>My favorite rapper of all time is Lil Wayne and I adore Chief Keef and Young Thug.

<strong>How do you describe your music?</strong>

My music is like my personality.</p><p>And I don't have just one personality, I have many.</p><p>My music is cynical and naive.</p><p>My music is self deprecating and cocky.</p><p>My music is full of hope and desperation.</p><p>My music goes through every emotion that I do.</p><p>My music is honest.</p><p>Its funny because in relationships I am very guarded, but in my music I put it all out there no matter how unflattering.</p><p>My music is my place to be free.

<strong>Can you tell me about your latest project <em>Manic Pixie Dream Whore</em>?</strong>

MPDW is my baby.</p><p>Its my big dream finally peeking it's head out and allowing itself to be seen.</p><p>I dropped the record in December.</p><p>I started recording in June but the person who wrote those songs seems so long gone to me.</p><p>I'll always love MPDW because I'll never be in that place again.</p><p>It was me saying "<em>Im a fucking rapper damn it, respect me as such"! </em>To be honest, I'm already on to the next thing.</p><p>But listen to it anyway!</p><p>I heard it's really good!

<strong>So everyone in my circle is talking about your <em>Severed Dick</em> song/video – what's the story behind that track?</strong>

I wrote the song for Worldstar – shout out to Q. MPDG was already mastered and everything.</p><p>I had the idea for the video in my head for a while.</p><p>I just didn't have particular song in mind.</p><p>I knew the penis mutilation video would be perfect for Worldstar because it would grab attention.</p><p>I just needed a way to work the concept into the title so I could really make people wanna click.</p><p>I was thinking about Dick Biter at first, but that didn't flow right to me.</p><p>So I changed it to Severed Dick, heard the beat, started freestyling to myself, and that's how I got the song.</p><p>For the record, the song does <em>not</em> promote misandry in any way, shape or form.</p><p>I just wanted to make a light hearted song that deals with dating from a realistic female perspective.</p><p>So boys don't take it personally.</p><p>Your man bits are safe with me.

<strong>What are you currently working on?</strong>

I'm in the process of recording my second mixtape <em>Mainstream</em>.</p><p>Its going to be out April or May.</p><p>Look out for that.</p><p>Its gonna be like MPDW's big sister.</p><p>Still me, but much more focused and refined.

<strong>What is your overall goal as an artist?</p><p>What do you hope that people take away from your music?</strong>

There are so many female pioneers in hip hop that I have to thank for my existence.</p><p>I could sit here and name them all, but anybody who supports female rappers already knows that much.</p><p>I'm here to push it even further.</p><p>Yes female rappers are getting shine now but we are still limited.</p><p>There are no females out right now who rap how I rap, or who share my perspective.</p><p>I have a way with words but my most valuable asset is my honesty.</p><p>I have been through a lot, and struggled with depression and self esteem issues.</p><p>I'm here to tell people its ok to be flawed.</p><p>Those flaws are a part of what makes you who you are.</p><p>None of the female musicians I looked up to growing up made me feel that way.</p><p>They were all hiding behind this facade of perfection.</p><p>I aim to change the way people view female rappers.</p><p>I aim to be an Icon.</p><p>A legend.

<strong>Any last words for our readers?</strong>
