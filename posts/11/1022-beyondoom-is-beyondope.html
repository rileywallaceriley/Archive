  <h1>BeyonDOOM Is BeyonDOPE</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><p>It's no secret that the Brooklyn emcee/actor Mos Def is a fan of MF DOOM.</p><p>Almost every rapper in that pocket is.</p><p>How could you not be?</p><p>His wordplay is godly – even if it almost seems jarringly off putting at times.</p><p>His ingenuity and <i>ironically</i> marketable lack of "commercial appeal" are what every rapper wished they had.</p><p>Rightfully so.</p><p>So it didn't surprise fans that much when he released <a href=" video</a> both praising the rapper, and effectively outing himself as a super-fan.</p><p>He then joined DOOM for a joint tour, which ended kind of disastrously due to DOOM's lack of attendance – and use of non-worthy stand-ins.</p><p>I was at the Toronto show during that tour, which was the show following the "riot inducing" <a href="http://www.fakeshoredrive.com/2010/02/promoter-speaks-on-mf-doom-concert-dooms-entrance-exit.html">Chicago show</a>.</p><p>That's another story though.</p><p>After that point, Mos seemed to refrain from <i>publicly</i> aligning himself with the now UK-based villain.</p><p>That's until recently.</p><p>Mos, now known professionally as Yasiin Bey, was the star of the 7 part, gradual release web-series <i>BeyonDOOM</i> by Culturebox, France Televisions' digital Art &amp; Culture on demand service, paying homage to DOOM.</p><p>Gradually revealing more of his face as the series progresses, Mos spits various doom tracks, including <i>Accordion</i> and <i>Curlz</i> (amongst others).</p><p>Not fully clear on the intended purpose of the project, or what they're trying to promote, but it's <b>super</b> dope, and gets my seal of approval.</p><p>Give it an eye.
