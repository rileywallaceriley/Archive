  <h1>D'Angelo's Black Messiah Delivers</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Core audiences – they ride and die for their favourite artists.</p><p>If artists treat them well, they will be with them forever.</p><p>If you look to other genres of music like rock and roll, artists like The Rolling Stones can sell-out shows anytime, anywhere.</p><p>This is largely due to the fact that fans <em>grew</em> with them and can link their music to specific periods in their life.

We have similar artists in the hip-hop/neo-soul (alternative) music world – think artists Outkast, Erykah Badu, The Roots or even a group like M.O.P. Performers that reached extreme heights of commercial success at <em>one point or another</em> and gained notoriety using a specific formula.</p><p>Artists like Erykah Badu continue to make music that, although experimental at times, does not venture outside the comfort zone of it’s core audience (NOT a bad thing).</p><p>The opposite can have disastrous results, as we experienced when Lauren Hill did string of highly criticized shows that saw her revisiting and reimagining her classics.</p><p>Enter platinum selling artist D’Angelo, a neo-soul messiah who brought us hits like <em><a href=" (How Does It Feel)</a></em>, <em><a href=" &amp; Right</a></em>, <em><a href=" Sugar</a></em>, <em><a href=" <em><a href=" Pie</a></em> and <em><a href=" His two commercial releases <em>Brown Sugar</em> and <em>VooDoo</em> are often cited as two of the most <em>excellent</em> and <em>singular</em> R&amp;B albums of the past 15 years.</p><p>He’s worked with the likes of J.Dilla, Dr.</p><p>Dre, DJ Premier Common and more.</p><p>Numerous set-backs, including legal and personal health issues, prevented the completion and release of his long-awaited third LP, which was tentatively named <em>River James</em>.</p><p>Today, after 14 years of waiting, fans (including us) woke up to find the album, which ended up being titled <em>Black Messiah</em>, was gracing our Spotify accounts.</p><p>Our upfront impression – we love it.</p><p>To put it simply –do you like D’Angelo?</p><p>You’ll love this album.</p><p>He gives his core audience exactly what they want from him, in a good way.</p><p>Although it includes writing credited to Q-Tip and production credit from Questlove (and others), the largely self-produced album is a gem.</p><p>From the buttery <em>Sugah Daddy</em>, the super smooth, head nodding <em>Prayer</em>, the Questlove co-produced <em>The Charade</em> or our current fave <em>Till It’s Done (Tutu)</em>, D’Angelo gives us a project completely on par with his other work, not an easy feat.</p><p>A great listen front to back – definitely add this album to your collection, playlist, etc.</p><p>Grab the album now, available anywhere you buy music.
