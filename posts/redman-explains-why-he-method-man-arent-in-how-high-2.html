    <h1>Redman Explains Why He & Method Man Aren't In "How High 2"</h1>
    <div class="meta">2018-10-16 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>After a decade of hyping up the long-awaited sequel to the cult classic How High, fans were less than impressed to discover Lil Yachty and DC Young Fly will star in it instead of Method Man and Redman. They were even more upset after learning the iconic duo wouldn’t be appearing in the film at all.In the aftermath, Redman called into The Grass Routes Podcast to break down what went wrong.“Me and Meth we’re not aware of the transaction of this movie,” Red confesses.Funk Doc says they didn’t own the rights to the film, so a branch that exists under the Universal Pictures umbrella was able to move without the duo’s blessing.“My thing is, you have the Red and Meth brand that [helped build] and create this ... those are all our ideas,” he continues. “When the new deal came about, we weren't involved in it.”According to Redman, two writers were working on a version with him and Method Man.</p>
<p>After an initial table read, they requested a few changes be made.“As far as me and Meth know, we were waiting on a new script to read for How High 2,” he says.Like fans, they were caught off guard by the Yachty announcement. Although they've been presented with an opportunity to be part of the sequel, Redman says it didn't feel right due to the way things were handled.“Yachty and DC have nothing to do with it," he says. "It was just all business.</p>
<p>I look at it like this man -- when one door closes, another one opens and that just leaves room for [me] and Meth to do a whole new movie."He adds, "We got a dope idea movie we been sitting on for the longest that we might do ... we had this idea like right after How High.“Listen to the full interview above.[apple_news_ad type="any"]</p></div>
