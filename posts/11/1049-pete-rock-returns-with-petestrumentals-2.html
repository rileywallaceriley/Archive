  <h1>Pete Rock Returns With PeteStrumentals 2</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>There have been a mountain of indie artists with songs "produced" by Pete Rock on their mixtapes over the past 15 years – and almost as many had songs produced by Dilla.</p><p>In the case of Pete Rock, many of the beats tend to all lead back to his monumental release, <i><a href="https://youtu.be/wV1RWQP-jXs">PeteStrumentals</a></i>.</p><p>The album, which turned 15 this year, was part of the Beat Generation Series, released by BBE Records.</p><p>This groundbreaking series, which launched with Dilla's timeless <i><a href=" 2 Detroit</a></i>, also featured projects by the likes of Jazzy Jeff (<i><a href=" Magnificent</a></i>), Marly Marl (<i><a href=" and more.</p><p>PeteStrumentals was the second entry in the series.</p><p>PeteStrumentals is one of the many reasons that Pete Rock should be on your list of greatest producers in hip-hop history (right up there with Dilla).</p><p>The songs on the album were originally recorded during the golden era (1990-1995), right in the same pocket of time where he produced joints like <i><a href="https://youtu.be/e5PnuIRnJW8">The World Is Yours</a></i>, <i><a href="https://youtu.be/BONgL61snlM">T.R.O.Y</a></i> and <i><a href="https://youtu.be/j_9eAZJloIU">Shut Em' Down</a></i>.</p><p>So they definitely have that same stank – so to speak.</p><p>Today, fans of the original, and a new generation of producers and hip-hop aficionados, can fill their ear holes with Pete's follow-up, <i><a href="http://www.mellomusicgroup.com/products/pete-rock-petestrumentals-2-2xlp-gatefold">PeteStrumentals 2</a></i>.

Unlike his original entry, this time around there are no vocals at all.</p><p>This is a purely instrumental effort.</p><p>Now before rappers start soaking these beats up with spit, please stop and really take this project in.</p><p>There are a sea of producers out there today.</p><p>Technology has afforded an extremely lax barrier to entry into the field.</p><p>Not to get all righteous, but much like the field of photography, the youth these days don't know how easy they have it.</p><p>This project doesn't miss a beat, like at all.</p><p>I remember <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/hip-hop-and-video-games-the-oh-no-interview/">an interview I had with producer/Rapper Oh No</a> – Madlib's brother and one half of the duo that produced all the music for <i>GTA V</i>.</p><p>He told me a story about a time he bumped into his longtime friend Dilla at a record shop, and Dilla passed him a beat tape.</p><p>He described the feeling he had when he first listened to the tape.</p><p>That feeling, although not as "exclusive", is similar  (I assume) to the feeling I got off the rip when I first jammed <i><a href="http://www.mellomusicgroup.com/products/pete-rock-petestrumentals-2-2xlp-gatefold">PeteStrumentals 2</a></i>.</p><p>It sounds hungry, immediate and above all, the product of tireless digging and sleepless nights.</p><p>The rapper in me gets restless about halfway through the 4th joint.</p><p>After 15 years, Pete Rock is, and always will be, my fave producer.</p><p>This new CD will is a solid milestone in his amazing body of work.
