  <h1>Chance The Rapper Sets Off Body Shaming Drama After Instagram Flub</h1>
  <div class="meta">2017-05-15 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Instagram has an incredibly easy-to-navigate interface on mobile devices, but coupled with that ease comes the ability to make mistakes.</p><p>This is especially true if you have big thumbs and don't scroll with absolute precision.</p><p>Grammy Award-winning philanthropist Chance The Rapper learned this the hard way over the weekend when he "liked" an inappropriate comment while scrolling through content.</p><p>Rather than stay mum and face the impending storm with a "wait and see" approach, Chance took to his Twitter account to fess up to the mistake and clear up any misconceptions.The apology included a quote of a since-deleted tweet by a Twitter user who pointed out the "like" by Lil Chano on a comment that read, “Just puked," which was posted on a photo of plus-sized models on WorldStar’s Instagram page.To say that none of us have made a similar mistake would be dishonest.</p><p>Many followers, who probably would never have noticed this had they not been prompted, were quick to dismiss it.</p><p>Others pointed out that he could have simply "un-liked" it.</p><p>It should be noted, however, that the notification from the initial "like" would still be sent to the account owner.Naturally, there were some who weren't buying the story and viewed the incident as a quick-thinking PR spin.There's an excellent chance this apology drew more attention to a (seemingly) non-issue to some than it may have received otherwise.</p><p>Given Chance's track record, which includes monster donations to Chicago schools, it's very likely this was nothing more than an accidental "like," and not in any way a case of intentional body shaming.</p></div>
