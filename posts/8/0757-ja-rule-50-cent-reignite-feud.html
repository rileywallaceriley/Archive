  <h1>Ja Rule & 50 Cent Reignite Feud</h1>
  <div class="meta">2018-01-19 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>It’s been years since the beginning of the savage back and forth between 50 Cent and Ja Rule.</p><p>But following a comment from Fif during an interview on Big Boy’s morning show on REAL 92.3, it appears that Ja isn’t about to sit back and let the Power producer control the narrative.https://youtu.be/3dXrTaYUi9U?t=24m55sDuring the Big Boy’s Neighborhood interview alongside his Den Of Thieves co-star O'Shea Jackson Jr., Fif notes that he’d put Ja to bed if he saw him in the streets in 2018.</p><p>Ja, who clearly isn't having it — sounded off on Twitter stating, “Fun hip hop FACT, @50cent is PUSSY.”Fans almost immediately started roasting him.Ja responded a few more times, pointing out that he is about that smoke and — once again — he didn’t start this. “I mind my business ... but for some reason 50 Cent keeps my name in his mouth,” he tweeted.“I think he’d rather have my dick in his mouth,” he continued.After a few other tweets Ja claimed 50 Cent had taken legal measures to protect himself from Ja.The claim about an order of protection was also brought to light again back in 2016 via Irv Gotti’s Instagram.Ja Rule appears to be continuing his tirade, currently fixating on his #ticklebooty hashtag.50 Cent's response is inevitable.</p><p>The question is, do we need a Ja and 50 feud in 2018?</p><p>Let us know in the comments.</p></div>
