BK don't play; native New Yorker Scion.Rae is taking listeners on a musical journey.</p><p>You can take a peek into every aspect of his mind through his music.</p><p>What his music lacks in grit, it picks up in soul and grizzly lyricism.</p><p>He spins tall tales about anything which crosses his mind--always something new, always something fresh.</p><p>The young man may be new to the game, but don’t sleep on the kid.</p><p>His newest record "Bittersweet" taps into the flute craze currently locking down the game, and delivers a gorgeous atmospheric joint with crazy wordplay.</p><p>Worth a spot on your weekend playlist!
