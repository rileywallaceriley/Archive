<hr />

Brooklyn is a hip-hop, Mecca.</p><p>Home to the likes of Notorious B.I.G, the borough has birthed some of the most thorough emcees of our time.</p><p>This week I'm going to focus on one insanely underrated BK bred emcee, Pumpkinhead.</p><p>Now known professionally – on the battle circuit – as PH, Pumpkinhead, who got his first break on the Stretch &amp; Bobbito Show, first made noise in 1997 with the single <em>Dynamic</em>.</p><p>The joint received major mixtape burn thanks to it's Beat Junkies remix, which featured a host of artists including a young Oh No (now known to the world as Jean Grae).</p><p>Pumpkin released two solo (indie) projects but failed to achieve any mainstream success until his critically acclaimed <em>Orange Moon Over Brooklyn</em> (OMOB), which dropped in 2005 on Soulspazm/Rawkus.</p><p>The project, which was produced entirely by Marco Polo, was a breath of fresh air, and allowed PH to showcase his skills on a whole other level.
<blockquote>"I don't really care whether you order it, purchase it at the local record store, or download it directly to your iPod like I did.</p><p>All I can say is this - Pumpkinhead's "Orange Moon Over Brooklyn" is worth getting by any means necessary."

– Steve Juon, Rap Reviews (circa 2006)</blockquote>
It's bigger than records, though.</p><p>PH is noted among the elite in the field of Battle Rap.</p><p>He won <em>Braggin' Rites</em> in both 1998 and 1999 and made the semis of the <em>Blaze Battles</em> in those same years.</p><p>With a handful of more classic wins in the turn of the century, PH quickly became one of the biggest names in the New York underground – and eventually became president of the Grind Time New York Division.</p><p>After a hiatus to tour, PH finally returned to the ring with a classic win over Dizaster, who most notably slaughtered Canibus and faced Philly-rapper Cassidy.</p><p>Since <em>OMOB</em>, PH has started his label, released numerous mixtapes, appeared on multiple compilations, released a group album with his Brooklyn Academy crew and continued to actively battle.</p><p>If you slept on PH, it's no problem – because the magic of the Internet can allow you to explore his catalogue.</p><p>He's an amazing lyricist.</p><p>If you will, he's a rapper's rapper.</p><p>I've taken the liberty of compiling some of our fave PH joints below.</p><p>Give him a spin.

<strong>UPDATE 06/10/15</strong>

In EXTREMELY disheartening news, Pumpkinhead <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/new-york-rapper-pumpkinhead-dead-at-39-20150609#ixzz3cgReA2Vk%20">died early Tuesday</a> morning at the age of 39.</p><p>I learned of his passing on Facebook.</p><p>He was extremely well respected in the underground world, and in my brief interactions with him after I initially wrote this piece, he was a great guy – very humble.</p><p>Condolences to his family.</p><p>He lives on through his music.
