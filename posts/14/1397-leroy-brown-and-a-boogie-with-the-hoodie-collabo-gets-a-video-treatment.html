  <div class="content"><p>We've been onto <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/did-nba-youngboy-beat-jack-rapper-leroy-brown/">Leroy Brown </a>for a while now — and now he's blessing us with a new visual.</p><p>The Corona, Queens, Emcee had made some noise over the last year with <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/leroy-brown-a-boogie-wit-da-hoodie-connect-on-lets-get-it/">his collaboration with the much-hyped young rapper A Boogie With The Hoodie</a>, "Let's Get It," which was (purportedly) label suppressed due to friction between the two, has now emerged as a video treatment.</p><p>Conceptually it's a melding of a home invasion with dramatic drone footage that screams quality — above all else.</p><p>If you're a fan of the track, or if you're just discovering it, you won't be disappointed.
