    <h1>Kwamé Celebrates Birthday With Stacked Instagram Live Concert</h1>
    <div class="meta">2020-03-29 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Multi-platinum selling producer/rapper Kwamé celebrated his birthday by bringing fans one of the most ambitious Instagram Live endeavors yet: a six-plus hour showcase featuring a plethora of legendary MCs.Kicking off with Roxanne Shante, Kwamé treated his audience with guest after guest while mixing in DJ sets of classics from the '90s and early 2000s.The star-studded livestream provided viewers with plenty of highlights. One was Black Sheep's Dres, who previewed a verse off of his upcoming project produced entirely by the late J Dilla.</p>
<p>There was also a cornucopia of great conversations too, particularly Money B and Kwam sharing tour stories.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MB5u_we_0dg&feature=youtu.beA livestream with this many moving parts wasn’t without its hiccups though. One pervasive issue was individuals jamming up the requests, making it difficult for Kwam to add more artists.</p>
<p>As a result, Big Daddy Kane, LL Cool J and a host of others didn’t get to be a part of the experience.However, that did little to take away from the show. Things went so well it appears this is going to become a regular thing.</p>
<p>Kwamé even toyed with the concept of having an R&B format as well.For those that missed it, check out the full guest recap below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktCtyIFc1g&feature=youtu.beGuests in order:Roxanne ShanteHakeem (Channel Live)Kangol Kid (UTFO)DJ KoolChubb RockDres (Black Sheep)J.J.
