  <h1>Hi-Rez Teams Up With Steelers Running Back Le’Veon Bell For New Track</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sat, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Pittsburgh Steelers running back Le'Veon Bell AKA 'Juice' and indie juggernaut Hi-Rez, who <a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/indie-af-rapper-hi-rez-grinds-his-way-into-itunes-charts/">I’ve covered in the past</a>, have teamed up with Tae Fresh and Dani Devinci for a dope new song, “I Made A Dollar.”

Bell (who burns down the last verse) made headlines earlier this year after threatening to sit out the 2018 season if he didn’t receive a franchise tag—which essentially means he’d bank no less than the average of the top five running backs in the league.</p><p>Hi-Rez, in case you need a refresher, has one of the most dedicated fan-bases I can think of; his <i>Only For The Fans</i> series has been making some serious noise, and he’s been packing shows across the nation, and even across the border in my city (Toronto).

He even made a <i>Fortnite</i> rap; if you’re a gamer, you’re welcome.
