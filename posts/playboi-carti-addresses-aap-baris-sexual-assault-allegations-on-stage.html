    <h1>Playboi Carti Addresses A$AP Bari's Sexual Assault Allegations On Stage</h1>
    <div class="meta">2017-07-19 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Playboi Carti spoke publicly on the serious allegations brought against A$AP Mob co-founder A$AP Bari during a show in Santa Ana, California on Monday (July 17). “I don’t support none of that rape shit. Fuck all that shit.</p>
<p>Man look, that shit wack. I love women, that shit wack,” Carti told the crowd, prompting chants of “Fuck Bari.”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJv-w8MdnEAlthough he denounced Bari's actions, he was quick to dead the chants, telling the crowd, “But at the end of the day, that’s my muthafuckin’ brother.</p>
<p>Nah, ain’t no ‘Fuck Bari,’ that’s my brother, but that nigga — he did wrong bro.”The video of Bari, which began making the rounds online last Wednesday (July 12), put Carti in another awkward situation. His associate and one-time manager Ian Connor also had multiple sexual assault and rape allegations brought against him last year.The 20-year-old "Magnolia" rapper — and A$AP Mob affiliate — was put on by Bari, who took him under his wing and introduced him to A$AP Rocky back in 2015 at SXSW.After the video went viral, Bari issued a statement adamantly denying an assault took place — adding that the issue was “amicably” resolved.Carti's performance comes hot on the heels of A$AP Rocky's show at the Agenda Festival in Long Beach, California over the weekend, where he altered the lyrics of the song "Telephone Line," apparently calling Bari a "bitch."https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAWy1xkM-FQ</p></div>
