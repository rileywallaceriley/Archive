  <h1>Beyoncé Explains Her Duty To Help Up-And-Coming Artists</h1>
  <div class="meta">2018-08-06 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Last week, reports revealed 23-year-old photographer Tyler Mitchell would become the first African American to shoot the cover of Vogue at the behest of Beyoncé.</p><p>Now, the September issue featuring Mrs.</p><p>Knowles-Carter is available on physical (and digital) newsstands.“Until there is a mosaic of perspectives coming from different ethnicities behind the lens, we will continue to have a narrow approach and view of what the world  looks like,” Beyoncé notes in her interview with Vogue writer Clover Hope. "That is why I wanted to work with this brilliant 23-year-old photographer."The historic moment is significant for the pop star, who has watched barriers crumble in the industry firsthand. “When I first started, 21 years ago, I was told that it was hard for me to get onto covers of magazines because black people did not sell,” she says. “Clearly that has been proven a myth.”She feels it’s essential to use her status and open the door for emerging talent.“There are so many cultural and societal barriers to entry that I like to do what I can to level the playing field, to present a different point of view for people who may feel like their voices don’t matter,” she explains.She continues, "Imagine if someone hadn’t given a chance to the brilliant women who came before me: Josephine Baker, Nina Simone, Eartha Kitt, Aretha Franklin, Tina Turner, Diana Ross, Whitney Houston, and the list goes on.</p><p>They opened the doors for me, and I pray that I’m doing all I can to open doors for the next generation of talents.”Read the full interview here.</p></div>
