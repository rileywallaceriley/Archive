  <h1>The Lost Art Of Hip-Hop Skits Part 1</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>It seems as though skits are a lost art.</p><p>Perhaps it's a sign of the times.</p><p>The industry has become increasingly focused onsingles, and less focused on the development of cohesive projects; although, I guess that's not <i>entirely</i> accurate as of late.</p><p>There have been some excellent albums dropping, but none&amp;nbsp;have&amp;nbsp;ultimately revived the subtle art of the skit, which saw some amazingly historic highs throughout the golden era of hip-hop.</p><p>I thought it might be fun to explore some of my personal favourites, and the artists behind them.</p><p>Here goes part 1.

<b>WBallz – 187.4 FM on your dial!</b>

As far as skits and interludes go, Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre pretty much set the bar.</p><p>From the infamous <i>Deez Nuts</i> skit&amp;nbsp;to the more sophisticated WBallz 187.4 FM&amp;nbsp;device that made contributions on&amp;nbsp;<i>The Chronic</i>, <i>Doggystyle</i> and many of the notable releases from Death Row's heyday.</p><p>The second example had DJ Sal-T Nuts, and DJ Eaz-E Dick (and the jack-off hour) – as voiced by <a href="https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjq4deNlKzJAhVFmh4KHbUEDMEQFggcMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FRicky_Harris&amp;usg=AFQjCNEwjHrCKEN8hywIA1CbQq_MSbrk7A&amp;bvm=bv.108194040,d.dmo">Ricky Harris</a> –offering colourful commentary, fielding hilarious phone calls and setting up songs. Dr.</p><p>Dre was also responsible for the skits/interludes on NWA projects, notably <i>NIGGAZ4LIFE</i>, and even the D.O.C's classic debut.</p><p>No big deal.





<b>Where my Killah tape at God?</b>

Wu-Tang's classic debut album, 36 Chambers, had a handful of skits, but only one became the go-to reference point for my grade school class.</p><p>Raekwon and Method Man, immediately preceding the song Method Man, had a freestyle "torture" battle, naming comically horrifying acts they'd commit against each other.</p><p>We're talking everything from force feeding to hangers left on stoves.</p><p>Ouch.



<b>This is&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;mothafuckin&amp;nbsp;stick-up!</b>

Redman is a real colourful character, and his skits lived up to his personality.</p><p>From the possibly evil Dr.</p><p>Trebis, mock newscasts in the city of Newark, to his over the top -- and in a few cases death-defying -- robberies, Redman seemingly spent just as much time orchestrating his theatrical (almost) breaks in action as he did crafting his actual classics.

BONUS:

Early G-Unit

At the height of the G-Unit and Murda Inc. battle, 50 Cent dropped these utterly amazing parody skits throughout his mixtapes (pre- Get Rich Or Die Tryin'). 50 may have gone a bit off-the-rails in the creativity department over the years, but these are a reminder of fun it was to listen to this beef in its entirety.</p></div>
