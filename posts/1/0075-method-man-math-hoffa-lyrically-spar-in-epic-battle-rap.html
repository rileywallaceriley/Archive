  <h1>Method Man & Math Hoffa Lyrically Spar In Epic Battle Rap</h1>
  <div class="meta">2020-08-19 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Battle rap staple Math Hoffa first confirmed a legendary matchup between himself and Wu-Tang Clan heavyweight Method Man on Sunday (August 16) -- noting in a follow-up post that it would be dropping randomly during the week.</p><p>It appears that Wednesday (August 19) is the day, as the pre-recorded head-to-head was officially released.Though it may not be what fans had envisioned (being only one round as opposed to three), there is a lot to love about both the polished battle and crowd-free format.Math hit Tical with a barrage of bars packed with timely references to items such as the current pandemic -- on top of a bevy of clever gun bars.</p><p>Meth held his own, following suit while using his legendary status and iconic group as talking points.Humorously, Meth harkened back to a catchphrase coined by the late Ol' Dirty Bastard during his infamous 1997 Grammy-crashing rant."Wu-Tang is for the children, but I don't give a fuck about them," he barked as the battle drew to a close.Many were curious about how Meth would perform in a battle at this point in his career.</p><p>While there has been a limited history of battle rappers successfully crossing over to mainstream careers, there is an even more limited record of rappers doing the inverse.</p><p>Joe Budden faced Hollow Da Don at Total Slaughter in 2014 and was unable to translate his bars to the format convincingly.Canibus -- a rap titan who famously traded lyrical jabs with industry icon LL Cool J in his heyday -- couldn't even remember his bars and had to take out a notebook, crushing the souls of fans worldwide in the process.Next up for Math Hoffa is a battle between himself and Cassidy affiliate JAG, set to take place as part RBE's Mask Off event, available for stream on August 29, 2020.Check out Math Hoffa vs.</p><p>Method Man above.</p></div>
