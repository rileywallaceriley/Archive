    <h1>Netflix & Spike Lee Unveil “She’s Gotta Have It” Season 2 Release Date</h1>
    <div class="meta">2019-03-08 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Spike Lee’s Netflix adaption of his career-launching classic She’s Gotta Have It is back for another season — and it appears this time around, Nola Darling and company will be expanding the show’s invisible border beyond Fort Greene, Brooklyn.“I’m thrilled for you to get to know Nola Darling all over again,” Nola actress DeWanda Wise in a statement to Essence. “Spike, Tonya [Lewis Lee], our writers, cast, and crew traveled near and far to bring you something very special.”This season, Darling struggles with newfound success and ultimately has to decide if she will remain true to her self and her art, or give in to corporate pressures — a journey that helps transform the lives of those in her circle.The season announcement comes on the heels of Lee’s Oscar win for his film BlacKkKlansman — the first award he’s won since launching his career with She's Gotta Have It in 1986, which starred Tracy Camilla Johns as the OG Nola Darling.She’s Gotta Have It returns to Netflix on May 24.</p></div>
