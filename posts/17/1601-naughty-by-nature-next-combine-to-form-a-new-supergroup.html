<p>DJ KayGee produced Next's critically acclaimed debut album, <em>Rated Next</em>, in 1997, as well as their 2000 follow-up, <em>Welcome II Nextasy</em>.</p><p>Speaking about their relationship, KayGee said, "NEXT is a group that I've always stayed in contact with personally.</p><p>We always talked music, family, and potentially doing a family tour of all the artists I've produced.</p><p>The tour seemed to be impossible to do, so we decided maybe us doing a joint project will help ignite the family to come together.</p><p>And here we are… igniting the idea, leading off with 'That's Me'." RL from Next added, "For me, this feels like a coronation of sorts.</p><p>The reverence I have for Naughty and all that they've accomplished has always been my goal for the NEXT brand."</p>

<p>T-Low of NEXT also shared his excitement, saying, "Myself and KayGee talk on a regular basis, and we want to bring our whole family together.</p><p>In a perfect world, I hope this project makes the whole team see that we all can come together because if you think about the catalog each artist has, the show and/or project would be crazy."</p>
