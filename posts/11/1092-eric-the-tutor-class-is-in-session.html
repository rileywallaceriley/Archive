  <h1>Eric The Tutor: Class Is In Session</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Let's face it, the term DJ is very subjective – and that's probably the Internet's fault.</p><p>But let's be clear when you're in the presence of a true turntablist, the difference becomes crystal clear.</p><p>Kind of like drinking freshly squeezed orange juice.</p><p>Real Mixtapes, by real DJs, were – back in the day – audio adventures that took the listener on a journey.</p><p>Every nuance, including the track list, was laboured over, and the products stood the test of time.</p><p>Kind of like classics by DJs like <a href="http://youtu.be/wzFmYx0jEBU">Rectangle</a>, <a href=" or pretty much the entire Beat Junkies crew, just to name a few.</p><p>Needless to say, I'm a sucker for a well thought out, and seamlessly executed mix.</p><p>One DJ who I've up on for a while now is Eric The Tutor.</p><p>He's in every sense of the word a You-Tube, celebrity DJ.</p><p>Why do I say that?</p><p>Well, his mixes have earned him over 64,000 subscribers, and over 15 million views.</p><p>His themed 'best of' mixes, such as his Biggie, Tupac, D'Angelo tapes, and his epic 8-hour long old school hip-hop mixes have made him something of legend online.</p><p>I reached out to Eric to learn a little bit more about his background in the DJ game, his influences – and how he feels about his You-Tube success.

<b>How did you get into DJ'ing?</b>

I always wanted to be a DJ.</p><p>Ever since I was a little kid.</p><p>I think from the moment I first heard hip-hop and reggae in the early nineties I was hooked!</p><p>I never looked into though until years later.</p><p>I was busy running a tutoring company (hence how I got my DJ name), and one of my students' parents owned a DJ equipment distribution company.</p><p>They were nice and hooked me up with some equipment, so I started practicing.

<b>Who were some of your influences?</b>

It's hard to be from Montreal trying to become a DJ and not be influenced by whatever A-Trak is doing.</p><p>He's such a force in the DJ/music community.</p><p>I always loved scratching, one of my first mentors was MTL DMC champ DJ mana – he was/is beyond technically skilled.</p><p>I like to listen to everyone to get a feel for what they're doing, the direction they're going in, etc.

<b>What was your reaction to the attention you started getting on You-Tube?</b>

The You-Tube success wasn't overnight, It was more of a steady grind; but, of course, it's great that so many people listen now.</p><p>I think one of the most important goals of music (and why I got into DJ'ing) is to share it with as many people as possible.</p><p>I get tons of people messaging me saying how they enjoy the music – and sometimes I get amazing, personal, inspirational thank you messages.</p><p>Those are always the most gratifying.</p><p>It's also given me a platform to connect with amazing people from around the world that I would never connect with otherwise, and I get to meet them when I travel, so it's great.

<b>Of all your mixes, do you have a favourite mix?</b>

I don't think I have a favourite mix.</p><p>I listen to a bunch of my mixes, is that narcissistic?</p><p>I listen to the D'Angelo mix a lot, though, he's my favourite artist, so I'm probably biased.

<b>Who are your fave artists out right now?</b>

My current favorite artist is the Weeknd; I love the new take on r&amp;b.</p><p>J Cole raps a mean bar too – he's got a nice old school flow, but it sounds fresh.</p><p>Oh, and that Jamie XX, Young Thug &amp; Popcaan track <i>Good Times</i> has been on repeat for a minute!
