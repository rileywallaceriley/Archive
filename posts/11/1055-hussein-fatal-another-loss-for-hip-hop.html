  <h1>Hussein Fatal: Another Loss For Hip-Hop</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>This was going to be a great week.</p><p>I had spent a portion of my weekend preparing questions and research for an upcoming interview with Hussein Fatal, 1/3 of the Tupac affiliated Outlawz; unfortunately, it wasn't meant to be.</p><p>Tragically, he was fatally injured in a car collision in Georgia, leaving behind three daughters and many broken hearts.</p><p>Our interview may not have worked out before he passed, but I felt I needed to complete this piece to introduce the world to his body of work, and his life.</p><p>Fatal was born/raised in Montclair, New Jersey, and – like many rappers before and after him – was involved in the drug game.</p><p>His life took a positive turn after being introduced to Tupac Shakur by Yali Kadafi (a friend/collaborator who was also a member of the Outlawz).</p><p>After some impromptu auditioning, he was officially inducted into the fold.</p><p>He went on to feature on some of Pac's most notable joints on his double-disc classic <em>All Eyes On Me</em>.</p><p>Namely: <em><a href=" We Ride</a>,<a href=" All About U</a></em>, and, of course, the infamous<em> <a href=" Em’ Up</a></em>.</p><p>That album has since has been certified Diamond by the RIAA, which makes it one of the best-selling albums (ever) in the U.S.

Tupac, as we all know was tragically gunned down in Vegas at the – in hindsight – unbelievably young age of 26.</p><p>Fatal wasn't with him that night, as he was home in Jersey for a court date.</p><p>Shortly after, Ouglaw brethren Yaki (only 19 years old) was also gunned down.</p><p>Fatal, in the wake of so much loss, quit rap and turned to the street; however, the birth of his first daughter inspired him step back into the game.</p><p>His solo career had a number roadblocks, like a label folding, wack marketing, and incarceration, but he overcame and released 4 solo albums – on top of some collaborative efforts.</p><p>His journey through the latter part of the 90's and 2000's had layovers on Relativity, Rap-A-Lot and even Murder INC for a short stint.</p><p>He eventually started his own label, where his catalogue from 2009 onwards currently resides.</p><p>His death is tragic, and with him, we lose another link to the legendary Tupac.</p><p>Many rap fans, especially younger ones, often tend to name drop Pac in <i>best-of </i>lists, but unless you were experiencing his "aura" as it happened, you’ll likely never understand the impact he had on music, and socio-political rhetoric of the time.</p><p>As well, The Outlawz were a different type of posse.</p><p>Unlike say Junior Mafia, who were largely ghostwritten by Biggie (and others), they were actual artists.</p><p>Fatal was a serious artist – with an impressive catalogue.</p><p>His debut album is a must-listen for sure.</p><p>Fans continue to mourn, and speculate the mysterious nature of Pac's death.</p><p>Fatal was often cited amongst the liner notes of the "conspiracy", and if Tupac truly is alive in Cuba, <a href=" coordinates</a> are likely gone with Fatal.</p><p>I had planned to nerd out with Fatal about his time with Pac, his insights on the game and the future of his label, but sadly I’m instead writing this retrospective.</p><p>I think it’s only right to share a collection of his music here with you – and invite you to help his family <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/z6j498">send him off right</a>.</p><p>RIP homie</p></div>
