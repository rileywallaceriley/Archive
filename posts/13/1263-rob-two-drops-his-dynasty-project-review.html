  <h1>Rob Two Drops His Dynasty Project [Review]</h1>

-- Rob Two</blockquote>
Inspired his pastor father – who started his career as a bass player – Robert Johnson (professionally known as rapper Rob Two) started out in the church as a drummer for the choir.</p><p>He took a hiatus from music, though, to follow the money and creative freedom that came with videography and photography work.</p><p>The allure/draw was too great, though, and before long he was back at it, writing and producing music.</p><p>His career seemed to metaphorically mash the gas pedal with the release of his record “Jugg,” which received a quality visual treatment.</p><p>Since that point, he’s seen his social numbers jump, and was even blessed to hit the stage during SXSW.</p><p>It has all led up to this, though.</p><p>His first  project, “Dynasty,” is a cohesive well-produced ode to his journey up to this point, as well as a braggadocios salute to the good life.</p><p>With the exception of the money-centric “Fasho,” produced by Young Bugatti, all the records were produced by Rob himself and  his in-house producer Supaonthebeatz; the result is a very unified sound and vibe throughout, making the listening experience very consistent.</p><p>The album has a bassy vibe that sits eye level with the current wave running this game, but what’s refreshing is Rob’s approach.</p><p>He tends to acknowledge his come up from nothing, but not in an annoying way – songs like “Dreams,” chronicles his path in the life, while “Runnin” outlines his hustle; the latter includes an endearing voice over from his mother commending him for not giving up on his dream.</p><p>You can hear the pride in her voice.</p><p>The highlights – for us – was track three, “Everyday,” and the co-produced “Celebration.”

He’s kind of in the vein of Tory Lanez, but with an edge that favors contemporary rap more than singing, though he does have a more sing-songy vibe on records like the lady-focused “4 AM.” He seems to have a solid pen game, a good handle on what seems to work in today’s climate, and – judging on his outro – a humble demeanor that makes him strangely more relatable.</p><p>I’d love to hear what he would on slightly different vibes.</p><p>Dynasty is a solid effort worth a spot on your weekend playlist.
