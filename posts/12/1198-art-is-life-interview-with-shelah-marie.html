  <h1>Art Is Life: Interview With Shelah Marie</h1>

—Shelah Marie</blockquote>
Maybe it’s because I’m a father of two wonderful daughters, but I find myself relating verbatim to Nas’s “Daughters.” Whenever I see women being negatively or unfairly portrayed in the media in any way, I see my daughters, and my heart breaks a little.</p><p>This was the case when I started seeing the  fashion in which some outlets were shining light on Ace Hood’s girlfriend, the lovely Shelah Marie.</p><p>She’s a yoga loving, theater performer that’s easy on the eyes — no question.</p><p>But she’s also a well educated, articulate, and creative soul, who’s used theater as a philanthropic tool to create positive change in the world.</p><p>Definitely, more than just "Ace’s Bae."

I decided to reach out to Shelah and learn a little more about her background in the arts, her work, and her relationship.</p><p>Check out the interview below.

<strong>Tell me a little bit about yourself.
</strong>
I'm an actress, a playwright, and a meditation enthusiast.</p><p>I focus on self-love in no matter what avenue I’m using.</p><p>Right now I’m focusing on planning the #curvyandcurly conscious tour for summer 2017.

<strong>Maybe tell me a little bit about that .</p><p>How did it come together?
</strong>
Well, It began when I was just starting to get (Instagram) followers beyond people that I already knew.</p><p>I was like, "What -- people that don’t know me want to follow me, why?" You know, so I started to think, "Okay, I should make a hashtag that resonates with me so that everything can be in one place." I just thought of something that was true for me; I was curvy and curly, and that’s how the hashtag started.</p><p>I began to notice that it seemed to draw people in.</p><p>Women appeared to be drawn to it as a support system for body love, and men were drawn to it because -- well -- they love curly and curvy women.</p><p>I mean, mean who doesn’t?

<strong>Something that is interesting about you  is that you’re insanely well educated -- and you’re deep in the theater community.</p><p>How did you get involved in theater?
</strong>
I started acting when I was in high school.</p><p>At that time, l worked at TGIF Fridays.</p><p>This agent came for lunch there one day, and she saw me and she was like, "You should be modeling." Long story short, she became my first manager, and I started booking every single thing I went on an audition for.</p><p>I didn’t have any training at that point, and decided I wanted to hone this tool and make it work for me.</p><p>So I have a bachelors degree in theater from Florida University, and I also have a master's in performance studies from Tisch School of the Arts at NYU.</p><p>With that education I transitioned into teaching artists training, which means I'm an artist first, an educator second.</p><p>So I use the skills that I learned from the theater – from acting to developing other skills – with people both in school and outside of school.</p><p>I’ve also written and produced plays that have traveled throughout the country.</p><p>I’ve performed on TV; I’ve performed on film, and in many theaters in New York City.</p><p>So acting is something that I love to do, and I’m looking forward to manifesting that more here in South Florida which is like a whole new world to me.

<strong>Tell me a little more about the teaching work you do.
</strong>
Regarding teaching work, I was very lucky.</p><p>New York has a high standard of education in general and especially arts education, and I worked for one of the biggest and oldest theaters for children and families in the country called The New Victory Theatre.</p><p>While I was there, I gained a lot of skills.</p><p>They trained us all the time; they gave us workshops and professional development.</p><p>Inside of the school, I worked from eight through 12.</p><p>I’m wasn't a full-time teacher so I could push in and out of the school.</p><p>I could do workshops for four weeks, three months, or even one-off workshops.</p><p>In New York, my curriculum was surrounding a work of art or a live performance.</p><p>But now what I do is I work with all kinds of groups.</p><p>I work with homeless groups, I work with the elderly, and I work with young people.</p><p>And I work with them to use skills learned from theater to make their lives better.

<strong>How do you do that?</strong>

One of the things I used to do is audition prep for young people that were going to audition for programs, like a theater program for example.</p><p>What I found in doing that, is that I don’t like teaching acting.</p><p>I do not like teaching drama skills for performance.</p><p>I do not like what it does to people, like for example; I was working with a girl, and I thought she was great -- and she works hard.</p><p>We were like three months in and then she doesn’t get into the school, all of a sudden she feels like a failure.</p><p>I didn’t want to be associated with that.</p><p>So what I do is I use skills and tools in the theater, for example, communication, eye contact, and being present, and I use all of that to teach life skills.</p><p>I just finished working with inner city girls that were kind of on the edge; I used theatrical tools to develop self-esteem and self-love.</p><p>So I do not teach acting.

<strong>That’s really interesting.</strong>

Thank you, I love it.</p><p>I live and breathe it.

<strong>It’s a really interesting approach; it's more like using theater as therapy.</strong>

One of the things that I was going to do was drama therapy -- and I do it in a weird way.</p><p>I’m not a certified drama therapist, but a lot of my work looks like drama therapy for sure.

<strong>Explain to me how your sustainability theater workshops came together.</strong>

I haven’t done one in years.</p><p>But the sustainable theater workshops is something that I created following my first trip to Haiti; I’ve since been to Haiti four times.</p><p>First time I went, though, I was shocked.</p><p>I was teaching kindergarten at this time in Harlem, and while I was in Haiti, I was teaching five-year-olds that were working so that their families could afford for them to go to school.</p><p>I was affected by that.</p><p>I just couldn’t come to terms with the fact that five-year-olds in one place get so much privilege and then five-year-olds in another place are working all day.</p><p>With that, I was like, "Let me see which tools and skills I have that I can bring into areas where they don’t have them." What the workshops did was use theater help the children to tell their stories as a form of therapy.</p><p>I held the Sustainable Theatre Workshop in Haiti first, then I did it in Jamaica, Senegal, and I did it in conjunction with the United Nations here in New York City.</p><p>It's about giving a group of young people the skills to create their work of art.

<strong>Is it something that you think you are going to do again in the future?</strong>

I am going to do it again in the future, it just needs reworking in my mind, because I found that it wasn’t sustainable.</p><p>There’s something about it at the core that I think needs to be revisited, and that’s why I haven’t done it again.</p><p>Because I can’t do anything, I don't feel totally passionate about.</p><p>Like everything I do, I have to believe in it 1000%.

<strong>Which is fair – makes for a better product, right?</strong>

Right, exactly.</p><p>I’m not here to bullshit anybody; you know what I mean?

<strong>So tell me about you and Ace – you’re the new hip-hop "it" couple.</strong>

Really?</p><p>That’s a huge compliment, thank you.

<strong>How did you guys meet?</strong>

Oh, we met on Instagram.</p><p>Every time I say this, I think of the fact that like when I first got an interview about this -- and I was like, "What do I say to this?" I called him, and I was like, "Ace should I make up a story about how we met?" He was like, "No, you should tell the truth." We were just following each other for a long time, and commenting back and forth and, you know, it was a year full of that kind of stuff.</p><p>I was like, "Why is this guy following me?" I’m thinking that I'm not his type; I’m not on that – you know, if you think of every rapper's type, I’m not that type.</p><p>So I didn’t think anything of it.</p><p>I was living in NYC at that time, and he was visiting, and my friends dared me to write him.</p><p>I said, "No way, I’m not going to write him, because it does not go down in the DM -- he’ll obviously think I’m a thot." You know what I’m saying, right?</p><p>I am not about that life.</p><p>Anyways, they broke me down, and I wrote him, and that was it.</p><p>I think we met up the next day, and there hasn’t been a single day that we haven’t talked since.

<strong>A lot of hip-hop industry couples end up on TV.</p><p>Do you guys see yourselves being on Love and Hip-Hop, or that kind of thing?</strong>

We were already approached by Love and Hip-Hop a few times, and we have both decided against reality TV.</p><p>We don’t want to be a reality couple.</p><p>We don’t want to be identified as reality stars; we want our work to speak for us.</p><p>Ace is an artist at the core.</p><p>He does care about fame, he does care about money, but really, he cares about his music, and he wants to be known as an artist.</p><p>I feel the same way.</p><p>So no reality for us, as it stands now.</p><p>Unless the face of reality just completely changes out of nowhere.</p><p>I mean, where it is now, no.</p><p>And I don’t want people in our fucking business, to tell you the truth.</p><p>I feel like I’m a little bit of a shit show now and then, and I don’t want people judging me.</p><p>I don’t want people in my relationship, you know.</p><p>I just think it’s too much access.

<strong>I don’t want to say it can destroy you, but it can destroy you.</p><p>Everybody in America can think you’re an asshole because of the way the show makes you look, right?</strong>

Exactly, and then the thing that I’ve learned is that one-minute people can love you, and the next minute people can hate you, and you just never know when it’s going to be.</p><p>You can never predict it.</p><p>And I don’t want to get too wrapped up in that.</p><p>Because It could twist in the drop of a dime, you never know.

<strong>I mean look, LHH has been notorious for that.</p><p>Where someone steps out and tries to do something and it just flops.</strong>

It’s so funny too because that’s one of their talking points.</p><p>Look at Omarion; they were trying to explain to us that it can enhance us as artists – I was like, “It’s the exception, but that’s not the rule."

<strong>What it can do is completely change your perception of how you look at those people.</p><p>I mean, LHH Hollywood made Soulja Boy look like an asshole — as a legit bad person.</strong>

And guess what?</p><p>It makes a difference.</p><p>It makes a difference because now do you listen to his music as readily?</p><p>Like Stevie J; he lost all his credibility.</p><p>But Omarion and his girl, they had a very good team.</p><p>Like they had a very good balance of visibility and private life — and they came out pretty good.</p><p>But I think just like I said, the exception is not the rule.I just don’t want to put myself in that.</p><p>I don’t want to be a reality star; I know I’m better than that.</p><p>No shade to any reality star, just for me.

<strong>And then if you try to do other things they’d be like "oh yeah, you’re that reality star."</strong>
<blockquote>I don’t want to be a reality star; I know I’m better than that.</p><p>No shade to any reality star, just for me.</blockquote>
Exactly, and I’m like, “No." I mean like even now, it’s a challenge for me not to be on some Instagram model shit.</p><p>I don’t even know what that is.</p><p>I’m not a model.</p><p>I’m not an Instagram model; It’s hard when people want to put you in one box and keep you there — in anything.

<strong>I mean, that’s part of why I wanted to interview you too.</p><p>Because when I started looking you up, you do a lot of things, but I saw articles like, "Ace Hood’s Bae, Top Ten Sexy Photos on Instagram.” I thought that downplayed you as a person...</strong>

I hated that.</p><p>Let me tell you; I cried the first time I saw it.

<strong>I was like, "Come on guys!"</strong>

XXL did something, Bossip did something a while back, a few other ones, but I mean, that’s what they do.</p><p>It was a bit tough in the beginning when you have your whole family, and all of your extended friends, and everybody watching you and reading those articles, but you know...it’s much easier.

<strong>What’s your favorite Ace Hood song?</strong>

I like "No More Mr.</p><p>Nice Guy," because I’m a theater person, and I think that song is so theatrical.</p><p>I just love it; it's dramatic.</p><p>Then I love "All The Way G," because he’s honest throughout that song — and he addresses a lot of things that he would never talk about.</p><p>To me, that song marked his transition to being able to articulate himself more in his music.





<strong>On a personal level, what are you working on right now?</strong>

I’m working on the Curvy,Curly, Concious tour for 2017; we are going to go to six different cities over the summer of 2017.</p><p>We’re trying to decide the cities right now, and we’re getting funded together.</p><p>So that's one of the things that I’m working on right now.</p><p>And then I’m also writing a one-woman show because my creative side is something that I haven’t been nurturing as much lately, and I need it.</p><p>So I’ve been writing, it’s been a few months.</p><p>I write every day --I’m in the process.

<strong>Do you have anything else you want to leave the interview with?</strong>

I think no matter what you do, no matter how you do it, I think people should find ways to love themselves — and each other -- more, and just be more positive.</p><p>I see a lot of it happening on my social media, and Ace’s social media, and if I can leave anything, it would be that.</p></div>
