<strong>How did you get into music?
</strong>
Well, I got into music around the age of 12.</p><p>I was always into poetry, but one day I decided to flow over Beamer Benz or Bentley, and it's been my lifestyle ever since.

<strong>Who are your influences in the game?
</strong>
Some of my main influences are, Nipsey Hussle, Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco, and J. Cole.

<strong>How would you describe your style?
</strong>
My music style is pretty versatile but lyrically, all of my songs convey some lasting message for everyone.</p><p>Lyrics should hit hard regardless of the beat and flow.</p><p>Some of my new favorite types of beats are electronic (somewhere between house, trap, and dance music) because they often represent my complexity.

<strong>Tell me more about your new project.
</strong>
<em>Laidback Extremist</em> is the first body of music I've ever genuinely loved.</p><p>It was the first time I ever went all the way in on a dream.</p><p>I started around winter time in my writing process.</p><p>Then I began to plan out a concept and strategy with a professional photo shoot, website, and merchandise.</p><p>It was originally just going to be called a playlist, but the amount of effort I poured into this project led me to call it an album even though it is available for free.</p><p>The whole Laidback Extremist album was a transparent statement for others to see how far I've come and how far they can come as well.

<strong>What's your goal in the industry?
</strong>
My goal in the music industry is to inspire as many people I possibly can.</p><p>I know artists like Nipsey Hussle encourage me to reach my success every day.</p><p>But for the thousands and millions who may not be able to connect with someone like Nip, there's Salvation.</p><p>The goal supersedes money and sales.</p><p>The actual benefit of the music will always be worth more.

<strong>What do you hope people take away from your project?
</strong>
After listening to my new album, I hope people will understand that my brand is really about "stimulating your mind, one step at a time." It's my slogan and I'm 100% serious about it.</p><p>I want to make beneficial music, and if I can create a sound that can make the people groove and still give someone a new outlook on life, the album is a success.</p><p>That "Fisker" video is coming soon by the way.

<strong>Any shout outs?
</strong>
I would like to shoutout all of the young guys grinding in the game right now.</p><p>Especially all the teenage guys and girls who came in this thing with no co-sign and still getting it.
