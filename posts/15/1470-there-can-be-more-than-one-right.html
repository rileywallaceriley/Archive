  <h1>There Can Be More Than One, Right?</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sun, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>By now you’ve seen and heard the throwback magic that is Bruno Mars’ “Finesse” remix featuring Cardi B. After a fantastic start to 2018 — being inducted into the elite group of artists to have their first three Billboard Hot 100 hits in the top 10 — many detractors are beginning to come around.</p><p>Including me, to be honest.</p><p>It’s also given more fire to the Nicki Minaj is washed, and Cardi is (in fact) the new queen argument.</p><p>Seven years of accolades aside, it’s hard to argue that she isn’t running shit at this moment.</p><p>Nicki must feel some sense of competition, clearly, as her work ethic over the past few months has been hectic.</p><p>The question is, though, why does Cardi’s success automatically mean Nicki is washed?</p><p>Without a defined head to head competition up for public judging, why does it feel like we can only have one female rapper in the spotlight.</p><p>Let me clarify; there are LOTS of talented female artists out right now.</p><p>But not many that are moonwalking across a mainstream plateau as high as Nicki and Cardi are currently.</p><p>We don’t do this to male artists.</p><p>Well, we do, but not like this.</p><p>In fact, I’d argue in the sea of extreme similarities and arguable mediocrity, and we give a lot of males artists a pass to shine in the same sky.</p><p>I think that perhaps I started to wrap my mind around this after hearing this mega-mix that melded a host of female artists on the “Finesse” instrumental.</p><p>Nicki and Cardi back to back sound phenomenal.</p><p>Like, the fact they aren’t putting together a collaborative EP — or at least a legit collabo (not a forced one like “Motorsport”) is a missed opportunity for Hip Hop in my humblest opinion.</p><p>The fact that Kim and Foxy never did that was a missed opportunity for Hip Hop.


&amp;nbsp;
This isn’t Highlander.</p><p>There can be more than one.</p><p>Stop gassing up bullshit.</p><p>Hip Hop is a competitive culture, but sometimes we just want to have fun, too.</p><p>Hopefully, 2018 will be the year that some of the most prominent female acts — again I’m squarely aiming this criticism at significant acts — can start forming super groups and collaborating like some of their male counterparts.</p></div>
