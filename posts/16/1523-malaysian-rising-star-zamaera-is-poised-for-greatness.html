23-year-old Malaysian MC Zamaera has been slowly bubbling onto many radars as of late.</p><p>After appearing on a viral installment of Yo!</p><p>MTV Rap Asia's <i>Rap</i> <i>Cypher</i>, knocking out her first festival appearance, and dropping a buzzing new single titled "Z vs Z" ahead of the upcoming EP of the same name, she is primed and ready to take things to the next level.

"Hip Hop in Malaysia has grown exponentially throughout 30 plus years," she explains to AAHH, indulging our ignorance of the regional scene. "I didn't live through the early stages of this groundbreaking period in the Malaysian music industry, but one characteristic of Hip Hop is its continuous evolution in sound, style, and swagger.

"It doesn’t matter if you jump on the Hip Hop bandwagon in the 80s or 2000s; if you have something to say -- visually, lyrically or sonically -- you're a part of the culture," she adds.


&amp;nbsp;
As Z explains, Malaysian society's reaction towards Hip Hop has been somewhat of a gradual appreciation.</p><p>She fell in love with the culture in her late teens. "Love, heartbreak and all the sweet sins of adolescence brought me to Hip Hop; and now I’m in it for life."

She's accomplished a lot -- considering her debut video dropped just over a year and a half ago.</p><p>This year, she was blessed with the opportunity to journey to the US to develop and focus her craft, and her career.</p><p>It was here that <i>Z</i> <i>vs</i>. <i>Z</i> was born.

"It was a very reflective period for me," she notes of the experience. "I did all of the creative work while I was there.</p><p>I worked with the amazing producer Floyd “Timeless” Thomas, writing the lyrics.</p><p>I also teamed up with the ever so talented creative director -- Kanya Iwana -- and the most brilliant ALL FEMALE TEAM, Savannah Chonis, Francesca Martin, Nawel Abdelaziz, and Shaina Santos for the album artwork.


&amp;nbsp;
"The experience was humbling, overwhelming and stimulating," she adds.</p><p>I was given a chance by Lakefront Records, which resulted in the recording of this EP in the United States .</p><p>It was overwhelming because I was in a foreign place, where EVERYONE is trying to make it.</p><p>Stimulating, because of the work ethic that I managed to experience.</p><p>The entertainment industry is no joke, and that motivated me to do more for myself as an artist."

The new EP, as she explains, is the essence of her as an artist, stemming from reflection and acceptance -- two things she describes as dominant themes in her writing. "It took about two months for the idea to be translated into the entire project," she reveals.</p><p>During her recent appearance at the Good Vibes Festival in Selangor, Malaysia, she had a chance to debut her two-month labor of love in front of a receptive audience -- an experience she doesn't take for granted.

"That was a day of many firsts.</p><p>The first time I performed at a festival, first time I used in-ear monitors, first time performing with dancers, first time I played the entire EP LIVE," she exclaims proudly. "I’ve learned to let go of the things I don’t have control over -- but all in all, it was an adventure of a lifetime."

With a dizzying 2018 thus far -- and an even more jarring 2019 ahead -- Zamaera's current mood is focusing on her mind, body, and soul.</p><p>With an endorsement deal with Nike Malaysia, her project, and (if it all pans out the right way) a tour, you can hardly blame her for cherishing a little downtime.

"Follow me on my social media," she says as our interview draws to a close, "because I will be announcing something extremely exciting very soon.”
