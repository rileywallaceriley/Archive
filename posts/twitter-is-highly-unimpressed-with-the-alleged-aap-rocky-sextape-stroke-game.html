    <h1>Twitter Is Highly Unimpressed With The Alleged A$AP Rocky Sextape & 'Stroke Game'</h1>
    <div class="meta">2019-12-19 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>A$AP Rocky has had a rather -- excuse the pun -- rocky 2019. However, it appears he's managing to end the year on a slightly humiliating, albeit more lighthearted, note.On Wednesday (December 19), the A$AP Mob honcho allegedly became the latest victim of a sex tape leak.A now-deleted video popped up on Pornhub of an unidentified man having sex, and though Rocky has yet to confirm anything, sleuths claimed it to be the "Fuckin' Problems" rapper due to not only a distinctive A$AP tattoo on his torso but also a tattoo one on his left hand.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liZm1im2erU&feature=youtu.beInitially seen as an early holiday gift for thirsty individuals, it soon became apparent Rocky -- whose exes include names like Kendall Jenner, Teyana Taylor and Iggy Azalea -- brought less than his A-game on the tape (if this is even classifiable).[related_article id="55946" type="news"]Fans seemed somewhat disappointed, especially considering his catalog and a recent interview in which he admitted to having struggled with sex addiction for the better part of his life.</p>
<p>He even noted he was (at the time of the interview) having issues designing a $100,000 bed to support the numerous orgies he was planning on having — something not generally associated with bedroom amateurs.Naturally, the reactions were priceless. Check out some of the best ones below.</p></div>
