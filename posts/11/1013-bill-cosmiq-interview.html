  <div class="content"><p>At the turn of the millennium, alternative hip-hop label Def Jux was dropping some pretty avant garde shit.</p><p>The game was in a weird place – the golden era was over, and we weren't as deep in the musical "cesspool" we're engulfed in today.</p><p>Artists like MF DOOM thrived in this particular pocket of time, as did the harlem duo Cannibal Ox.</p><p>Rappers Vast Aire and Vordul Mega, over a sound bed provided by El-P (one half of Run the Jewels), released <em><a class="fl ellip _Wqb" title="The Cold Vein (2001)" href=" Cold Vein</a></em> in 2001, which was acclaimed as one of the best hip-hop albums of the preceding decade.</p><p>Unfortunately, following a falling out with Def Jux, the duo all but disappeared.</p><p>After a serious of empty promises of a awaited reunion, they emerged with a dope <a href="https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCQQFjAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fblade-of-the-ronin%2Fid960141128&amp;ei=tqcRVff2OtLbsATGwoCQCA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEpD5kkwl0YlyIHPUhMGnuA9Eovng&amp;sig2=3pXAssGfEKHXYcwX9ALzSg">new album</a> <strong>and</strong> a new sound.</p><p>That sound belongs to New York-bred producer/rapper Bill Cosmiq.</p><p>I recently had an opportunity to chat with Bill about his music, his influences and how he became the go-to producer for one of hip-hop's most acclaimed underground groups.

<hr />

<strong>Can you start by introducing yourself to the people?</strong>

I’m a producer/emcee based out of New York City.</p><p>I’m ½ of the group “The Quantum” and lead producer of Cannibal Ox’s <em>Blade of the Ronin </em>album.

<strong>How did you get into music?</strong>

I’ve made music for years, developing beats for friends and local artists.</p><p>I never put pressure on myself to record albums in the past.</p><p>I jumped into the scene in recent years because I wasn’t hearing a lot of music I enjoyed.</p><p>I was compelled to make a contribution.

<strong>What/who were some of your influences?</strong>

I’m influenced by all great musicians.</p><p>Countless people have made an impression on me from Lee “Scratch” Perry to producers like DJ Premier and Timbaland.</p><p>Growing up, I remember seeing Quincy Jone’s signature on the back of Chaka Khan albums, movie soundtracks and Michael Jackson’s <em>Thriller</em> album.</p><p>Seeing those album credits drove my interest in developing music across genres.

<strong>How would you describe your sound?</strong>

I never put a label on my sound.</p><p>Once I try to define it, I set an unnecessary boundary.</p><p>I just try to keep it honest and inspired.

<strong>What’s your creative process like when you produce/write?</strong>

I try to get in a zone and allow my beats to naturally come together.</p><p>Sometimes I have a seed of an idea before I sit down and work, but most times I work without an idea of what I want the outcome to be.</p><p>Discovery is always part of my process.</p><p>While making a beat, lyrics start to come to me inspired by what I hear.</p><p>The music always drives a mood or mindset.

<strong>How did The Quantum (Salvador and you) come together?</strong>

We’ve known each other for years.</p><p>We worked on music because we have a similar vision of the records we want to make.</p><p>The response people had to our collaboration helped to drive the formation of “The Quantum”.</p><p>No gimmicks or forced music.</p><p>The Quantum is the middle ground where our creative styles meet.

<strong>Can tell us a little about the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/the-quantum/sets/the-quantum-paragon-ep"><em>Paragon EP</em></a>?</strong>

<em>The Paragon</em> EP was an introduction to The Quantum’s sound.</p><p>It’s a window into our mindset and what we are offering to the culture of Hip Hop and music community at large.</p><p>I feel like we are bringing the spirit of the “golden era” with a future-forward approach.</p><p>The EP also features Kenyattah Black, Taj Hotep and Vast Aire.

<strong>You are the main producer of the latest Can Ox project, how did that come about?</strong>

I linked up with Vast Aire years ago through a mutual friend, Taj Hotep.</p><p>The first track we released was <em>Royal Purple Bag</em> off of Vast’s <em>A Space Iliad</em> EP.</p><p>After that, Can Ox and I continued to connect and work on a number of records.</p><p>The team really responded to my beats which produced some inspired studio sessions.</p><p>Ideas exchanged back and forth and the consistency of those sessions helped to fuel the energy behind <em>Blade of the Ronin</em>.</p><p>It all comes down to chemistry in the lab.

<strong>What was the process of putting Blade Of The Ronin together?</strong>

I wanted the album to have a cohesive feeling all around.</p><p>We didn’t rush the creative process.</p><p>I let things come naturally and the compositions started developing an intense cinematic edge.</p><p>After we created “Gotham” in 2013, Cannibal Ox and I started to discuss <em>Ox City</em> and what that environment is like.</p><p>We discussed the look, tone and feel of that city. <em>Blade of the Ronin</em> is like a soundtrack that illustrates a walk through that environment.

<strong>What is your fave song on the album, and why?</strong>

I look at the album as a whole.</p><p>The whole listening experience of the album is favoured.

<strong>What's next for Bill Cosmiq?</strong>

I’m focused on producing more quality music and presenting my creative ideas to listeners.</p><p>The Quantum has a new project in the works and I’ve been collaborating with a diverse range of artists.</p><p>I’m interested in working on a film score in the near future as well.

…Cannibal Ox and I are still in the shop working on new heat!
