  <h1>Happy Dilla Day</h1>

  <div class="content"><p>It's been ten years since the great J.Dilla left us; however, his legacy is still burning as strong as ever.</p><p>There are a few reasons for this.</p><p>One is that his collaborators, friends, and family continue to keep his brand relevant, with new releases and merchandise.</p><p>Two, his – awe inspiring – catalogue contains timeless classics that will never fade.</p><p>As a writer, I'm well aware that my opinions might not always match yours, the reader.</p><p>That's because music is a very personal experience, often tied to very specific memories, emotions, etc.</p><p>My personal relationship with Dilla's music dates back to 1995 when I was on a school trip.</p><p>While at a mall in Montreal, I purchased a copy of The Pharcyde's <i>Labcabincalifornia</i>.</p><p>It's a tape that was not only a turning point and catalyst for my twenty plus year odyssey into the hip-hop rabbit hole, but is also something I still own today.</p><p>There were other producers on that album, but Dilla's bassline on the album's into song, <i><a href="http://youtu.be/UhecITFLbPs">Bullshit</a></i> had me open from the first lick. <i><a href="https://youtu.be/co3qMdkucM0">Drop</a></i> was another joint that really f@&amp;ked my head, and the Spike Jonez video took it to a whole other level.</p><p>In fact, it stands as one of the coolest most original videos I've ever seen.</p><p>The most important record, though, was <i>Runnin'</i>.</p><p>I will stand and argue with anyone who disagrees that <i>Runnin'</i> was not Dilla's best beat; period.</p><p>Much like Will Smith's <i>Summertime</i> and Aaliyah's <i>One In A Million</i>, the song will always have a place in my heart – as it's been with me thoughout some high highs and low lows in my life.</p><p>Funny how music can do that.

Dilla's production was captivating, and right down to his final days, he put everything he had into his music.</p><p>He was his music, and his music was him.</p><p>I think this deep connection and his creative aura was what made his music so...charismatic...so, timeless.</p><p>Dilla was an innovator who fathered in a neo-soul vibe into the hip-hop landscape and inspired a generation of crate-digging hip-hop producers, who in turn will inspire the next generation.</p><p>So, I'll end this piece with an RIP to one of the greatest producers who ever did it – the late, great, J Dilla.</p><p>Happy Dilla Day.</p><p>Here's a 12 minutes Dilla Video-Mix.
