    <div class="meta">2017-07-27 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Houston, Texas rap legend Scarface recently took to Instagram to let fans know he's back in the studio and has some serious heat on deck. In a series of photos posted on Instagram Wednesday night (July 26), the Geto Boys MC and longtime producer N.O.</p>
<p>Joe previewed some new songs."So, I’m in the studio, and the fucked up part about me being in the studio is, I’m in the studio with this nigga,” Scarface said to the camera. "And the fucked up part about me being in the studio with that nigga ... it means somebody’s in trouble."N.O. Joe and Scarface have collaborated numerous times in the past.</p>
<p>The veteran beatsmith's production credits include Geto Boys' Till Death Do Us Part and The Resurrection, as well as Scarface's platinum-selling solo album The Diary and the gold-selling The Last of a Dying Breed.While Scarface didn't explicitly confirm that a full album is indeed on the way, some of his recent tweets hinted at his hunger to get back into the studio earlier this month.A fresh album would mark Scarface's first effort since 2015's Deeply Rooted, which dropped soon after a Geto Boys project fell apart because of a failed Kickstarter campaign.Check out the posts above.</p></div>
