  <h1>DAP The Contract Drops Touching Video For 'Too Young'</h1>

  <div class="content"><p>Having recently worked with Mark Ronson--thanks to a collaboration with Noisey and Converse Rubber Tracks--DAP The Contract is an artist with incredible potential.Seeking to make more than just a catchy tune, DAP draws influence from the world around him to create songs with depth; his social awareness produces striking dialogue, and it is seen most prominently in "Too Young."

Filmed and directed by Felege Gebru, the video for "Too Young" is dedicated to Michael "Uzi" Atobatele, Dave Okine, and the many children all over the world whose lives were tragically cut short. "This song was initially inspired by the need to comfort friends who had lost close friends of theirs.</p><p>However, as I wrote the song, I began to think about all the children suffering all over the world and the cries for help we see and scroll past on our timelines so frequently,” shares DAP. “The concurrent Syrian refugee crisis and the daily reminder of the extreme poverty that cripples the lives of children in my hometown Lagos, Nigeria only reinforced the importance of the song.</p><p>This song is dedicated to all children across the world that have passed away too young, and to those that continue to suffer every day."
