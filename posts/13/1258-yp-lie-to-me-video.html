  <h1>YP – Lie To Me [Video]</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sun, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Jackson, Michigan, is brimming with talent; from the homie Oneup2lovett, who we've featured numerous times in the past little while to YP, who we've only recently got up on.</p><p>A Jackson-native, YP has been methodically making a name for himself not only as an artist and performer but as a songwriter in general.</p><p>He and his brother -- collaboratively -- began performing at various WJLB  functions, and in conjunction with Floyd Mayweather promotions.</p><p>His biggest look, as a writer, came when he collaborated with A-Game Writers  to write the Nephrateri Lewis featured single "On Fleek," which appeared in the fourth episode of the second season of Fox's hip-hop drama, Empire.</p><p>His newest record, the sexy "Lie 2 Me, is an attempt by the Jackson upstart at furthering the buzz he's already set off with singles like "Are You Ready" and Day 1." Amidst a lush backdrop, which an artist like Bryson Tiller would be quite at home upon, the artist drops an anthem for the light-night love sessions with a side piece -- the high-quality video treatment by Cloudy Productions further the overall grandeur of the release.</p><p>Check it out for yourself below, and stay up for more releases from YP.</p></div>
