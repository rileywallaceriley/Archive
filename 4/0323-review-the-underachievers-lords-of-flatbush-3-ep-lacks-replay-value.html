  <h1>Review: The Underachievers’ ”Lords Of Flatbush 3” EP Lacks Replay Value</h1>
  <div class="meta">2019-06-01 — reviews</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Coming off of the highly anticipated Beast Coast LP Escape From New York, collective members Issa Gold and AK the Savior — better known as The Underachievers — gifted their fans with the third installment of their Lords Of Flatbush series.</p><p>As their first release since 2018’s After The Rain, the project is a short and sweet-ish listen drenched with dark soundscapes and mediocre (and at points, generic) subject matter that fails to capture the replay value of some of their discography’s shiniest offerings.https://youtu.be/wscSYH83ivAThe project’s biggest downfall is the monotony it suffers from repetitive, underwhelming production by YDNA and commonplace topcics that make it an easily forgettable body of work.</p><p>There are some bright spots; “Rowdy” sports subtle snaps that seem to complement their signature double-time rhyme schemes well.</p><p>The album’s closer “Randy Moss” does manage to exude the right energy and balance that most of the project is attempting to capture. https://youtu.be/eNLSaZZTnP4Where their more acclaimed releases like Indigoism or Evermore: The Art Of Duality were lauded for their melding of trap, boom bap, jazz, and psychedelic elements as a backdrop to their brand of conscious and hazy aesthetic.</p><p>Their past album After The Rain was heavily criticized for the group’s attempt at delivering what stands as their most “Hip Hop” project, a shift from the sound they built their base around.</p><p>Lords Of Flatbush 3 feels like a haphazard attempt at delivering what feels like the opposite — sonically.Less of a chore to listen to than a few of their weaker releases — at a relatively short nine songs — the duo’s technical skill as rappers is vastly drowned out by sonic drudgery that seemed to stunt a lot of the creativity we’ve come to expect from them.</p><p>Duality is something they’ve gotten really good at offering listeners; unfortunately, when they put all their eggs in one basket, the results lack luster.</p></div>
