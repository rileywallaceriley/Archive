    <h1>This Kawhi Leonard Photo May Inspire Drake's Next Freestyle</h1>

    <div class="content"><p>Flashing back to the 2001 Eastern Conference Semi-Finals, in which Vince Carter and the Toronto Raptors ultimately lost in Game 7 to the Philadelphia 76ers, Raptors' Kawhi Leonard gave fans redemption Sunday (May 12) with a heartstopping 21-footer buzzer-beater over Joel Embiid that clinched a 92 - 90 Game 7 victory.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urpY70oHg1gNow it appears a photo, taken of Leonard seconds before the shot bounced off of the rim -- and into the basket -- causing the Scotiabank Arena and the entire city of Toronto to erupt, may inspire a freestyle from the Raptors' team ambassador, Drake."I would do a freestyle just to use this as the artwork," Drake commented on the photo, shared by current Clipper -- former 76er -- Lou Williams. Williams himself has received on-wax immortalization from Drizzy, who name-dropped the L.A. shooting guard on his song "6 Man" off of If You're Reading This It's Too Late.A freestyle by the team's biggest fan would be the icing on the cake for an epic series, in which Drake also made waves during Game 5, leading stadium-wide trolling of 76ers center Joel Embiid while wearing a Breaker High hoodie."That's something I never experienced before -- Game 7, winning shot," Leonard told ESPN of the shot heard around the world. "It's a blessing to get to that point and make that shot and feel that moment, and it's something I can look back on in my career."ESPN has also noted that this is the first Game 7 buzzer-beater in playoff history.</p>
<p>The Raps will now face the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference Finals, which begin Wednesday (May 15) in Milwaukee.</p></div>
