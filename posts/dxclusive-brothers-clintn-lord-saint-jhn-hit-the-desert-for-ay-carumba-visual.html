    <h1>#DXCLUSIVE: Brothers Clintn Lord & SAINt JHN Hit The Desert For ”Ay Carumba” Visual</h1>

    <div class="content"><p>There is something to be said about having a sibling in the industry, and for Clintn Lord — brother of buzzing rapper SAINt JHN — the connection is birthing both motivation and stellar content. His latest release, ”Ay Carumba,” featuring his brother (who recently signed with Roc-A-Fella co-founder Kareem "Biggs" Burke’s management company), is just the beginning of a busy 2019.“I was studying color theory for a while ... I wanted to bring more life to my visuals,” Clintn tells HipHopDX of the video. “I know that the primary colors red and blue give each other movement.</p>
<p>All I could picture was three cars (red, blue, and white) flying across the desert.”The video was a spur of the moment occurrence. The brothers were in L.A. performing at the Hard Summer Music Festival and wanted to shoot something before heading home to Brooklyn.</p>
<p>The deep desert location they ultimately chose was the same one Post Malone used for his seminal video ”White Iverson.”“We used the show money to get two Mustangs and a 911 Porshe. I rode with my top down all the way there.</p>
<p>The first thing we did once we get to the set was argued over who’s ghost riding what,” he notes with a laugh.Filmed by Anthony Supreme, J. Cole's personal cinematographer, the video is just one of the few plays he has in the stash. “‘Set Big’ is my next release on wax,” he says, noting that he shot a video for the single in New York. “'Clintn Clinton' [another single] should be released around the same time ... another banger.”The more unspoken storyline of “Ay Carumba” is the undeniable musical chemistry he shares with his brother. “Growing up in the same household as someone gives you a different perspective on them,” he explains. “Our mom first heard about the collab and was like ‘I’m going to start praying for you’ and shook her head ... I love her.”Much like his brother, he began his career as a model, before transitioning to music.“Saint was writing for people ... I was more of a freestyler,” he says. “We had different abilities, but that was motivation.</p>
<p>It never affected my career.”Clintn shares the obvious excitement he felt watching his brother's ascent and points to the stark differences in their creative process.“We would get in the studio, I’d smoke a blunt and bring some girls ... he's more into having no one there and being in a focus zone. We had a studio on Times Square right above Quad Studios.“I used to leave and come back with like five girls and Chinese food ... he would kick them all out.</p>
<p>Because of this, we would usually end up recording at separate times," he says chalking the workflow up him being an annoying little brother.Watch Clintn Lord and SAINt JHN’s “Ay Carumba” above. His currently untitled LP drops this summer.</p></div>
