  <h1>Great Rappers You Slept Part 2: 90's Fat Joe</h1>

– AllMusic</blockquote>
The biggest problem with being a (major) hip-hop head, is that sometimes you end up in conversations with others, and you have to find a way not to come off as a know-it-all.</p><p>I wish I could explain how many times I’ve heard the South Bronx rapper Fat Joe described as being discovered by Big Pun.</p><p>It’s like looking at a crooked picture if you have OCD.</p><p>It's maddening.</p><p>I want to slap them and explain that Joe has been around for like <strong>EVER</strong>, and was an amazing, non-commercially motivated hip-hop architect during the golden era.</p><p>So here I go – let's all go back to 1993.</p><p>I thought i’d share a bit about the Fat Joe that most heads either don’t know, or don’t acknowledge (anymore).</p><p>Fat Joe was originally a member of the DITC crew, meaning he rolled with the likes of Diamond D, Showbiz &amp; AG, Lord Finesse, and the late-great Big L. He was vicious on the mic, and in 1993 on the Relativity Records imprint he dropped his debut solo album, <em>Represent</em>.</p><p>It was dope.</p><p>It featured production from his DITC brethren, as well as hip-hop mainstays like the Beatnuts.</p><p>The album spurred the iconic single <em>Flow Joe</em>, and the far less talked about <em>Watch The Sound</em> featuring Grand Puba and Diamond D. Keep in mind, this is 1993, so names like Puba and Diamond were a big  deal.</p><p>The album also had verses from Apache and Kool G Rap.</p><p>It also featured the original version of his classic <em>The Shit Is Real</em>.</p><p>Critics didn’t hate it.</p><p>Then Joe dropped his second album, <em>Jealous Ones Envy</em>, which i’ll preface by saying is one of those albums that just hit me the right way when it dropped.</p><p>It was the soundtrack to my life.</p><p>Let’s point out the goods: <em>The Shit’s Real</em>, and <em>Success</em> –both produced by DJ Premier. <em>Respect Mine</em> featuring Raekwon, <em>Bronx Tale</em> featuring KRS-ONE.</p><p>The album is so gritty, so NYC, and just so hip-hop. the production is absolutely gorgeous.</p><p>The <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">real</span> true gem here though, is the song <em>Watch Out</em>, which was the first recorded appearance of Big Pun.

Next up, Joe – high off the success of his new artist Big Pun – dropped the still "street", but slightly more commercial effort <em>Don Cartagena</em>.</p><p>It was super feature heavy, and had tracks that were made almost entirely for mainstream radio/tv, namely <em>Don Cartegena</em> featuring Diddy and <em>Bet Ya Man Can’t (Triz)</em> featuring Pun, Cuban Link and Triple Seis.</p><p>The album did have heat, like the still dope <em>John Blaze</em>.</p><p>Honestly, in hindsight, this album isn’t that "commercial".</p><p>Especially when you stack it against everything Joe made from this point on in his career.</p><p>It was just much less street than his first two releases; however it worked in his favour, selling Gold.</p><p>It was his most successful album to date.</p><p>Sadly, this is where the train has stopped for me.</p><p>I wasn’t really a fan of his music from this point on.</p><p>I mean, he had some heaters here and there, but it just got <em>way</em> too commercial for my personal taste; and that’s no shade, good on him.</p><p>He has a family to feed, and it’s all about building and elevating.</p><p>But for me, his music doesn’t have the soul it once did.</p><p>I highly encourage you dig into his past catalogue though, because he did exist before <em>What’s Luv</em> with Ashanti.</p><p>He’s the man who brought Big Pun to the forefront – and he deserves all the credit in the world.</p><p>Let’s pay tribute to 90’s Fat Joe!
