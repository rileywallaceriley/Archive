    <h1>Snoop Dogg Trolls Kanye West: “Drake Put Dick In Yo Bitch!”</h1>
    <div class="meta">2018-10-15 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>After appearing to bury the hatchet with Kanye following a long series of public criticisms of his subversive takes on everything — more or less — Uncle Snoop Dogg took to Instagram on October 14 to clown ‘Ye over a (late to the party) interpretation of Drake’s “In My Feelings.”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foSyh31UCm8“I just found out who Kiki was, [she] is your bitch. That’s why you’re so mad,” Snoop taunted, having seemingly just stumbled on the popular fan theory that Drake was referencing Kim Kardashian on the song.</p>
<p>Kanye condemned Drake during an Insta-rant last month over the Toronto rapper’s refusal to debunk the rumor.“Drake put dick in your bitch,” he continued. “Drake, you a cold nigga, cuz. I like that song but I ain’t know why I liked it.</p>
<p>Now I know why I like it. ‘Kiki, do you love me? Remember sucking me?’ Yeah, he put dick in your bitch.</p>
<p>How about that?”For added insult, Snoop — who is currently touring his live stage play, Redemption of a Dogg — made the post while in ‘Ye’s hometown of Chicago. He’ll be back in the Windy City on October 20 for two shows.[apple_news_ad type="standard"]</p></div>
