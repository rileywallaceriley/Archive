  <h1>Irv Gotti Is Resurrecting Murder Inc. With New Roster Of Talent</h1>
  <div class="meta">2017-05-10 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Irv Gotti's record label, Murder Inc., which later shortened itself to The Inc., is probably one of the most epic rise-and-fall stories in Hip Hop history.</p><p>What began in an early iteration as a three man group consisting of Ja Rule, DMX, and Jay-Z, became a chart-topping, Def Jam distributed behemoth that sold millions upon millions of records during its height.Unfortunately, after losing its footing as the result of a violent feud — on and off wax — with 50 Cent and his G-Unit camp and IRS trouble, among other things, the label saw decline in both relevance and power post-2003.</p><p>After losing the bulk of its artists by 2012, namely Ja Rule, Ashanti, and Lloyd (and even Charli Baltimore), Murder Inc. was for all intents and purposes, done (optically).</p><p>That is, until today.Irv Gotti took to his Instagram to announce that the label would be relaunching with a new roster of artists: "Oh and by the way!!</p><p>I’m about to RE LAUNCH MURDER INC RECORDS!!</p><p>I got some new artist.</p><p>New music.</p><p>Same f*cking MOVEMENT!" In his announcement, he also detailed how his legal situations had forced him to "fall back," before adding, "My Money is right.</p><p>And I’m back!!</p><p>Major Announcements Coming Soon."It should be noted that -- technically -- he already "relaunched" Murder Inc. back in 2013 as an umbrella label under his Visionary imprint.</p><p>At that point, when Ja was released from prison following a two-year sentence for gun possession and tax evasion, the label released "Fresh Out Da Pen" and "Everything." Ja Rule — following the most epic failure of his career (and maybe ever) — is far from a hot ticket, so all eyes will be on Irv's new roster of talent.</p><p>He did it before, so there's a very good chance he can see success again.Irv has also been busy casting for Tales, a show he developed in partnership with BET.</p><p>Looks like a lot of big things on the horizon.</p></div>
