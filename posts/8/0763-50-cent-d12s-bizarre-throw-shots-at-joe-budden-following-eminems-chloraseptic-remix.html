  <h1>50 Cent & D12's Bizarre Throw Shots At Joe Budden Following Eminem's "Chloraseptic" Remix</h1>
  <div class="meta">2018-01-09 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Eminem's "Chloraseptic" remix features what many believe is an uncharacteristically indirect diss directed at Shady Records artist Joe Budden.</p><p>But according to D12 member Bizarre, there was nothing indirect about it.In a Twitter back and forth, which has since been deleted, Bizarre called out Budden."Never bite the hand feed u," he wrote in a tweet directed at the former Everyday Struggle host. "Make sure u keep up that same Energy, @JoeBudden ... dont get quiet now."Budden promptly responded, "Biz, u ain't spoke to Em in at least 10 years, you better relax nigga before u make me angry." He later added, "I love you ...</p><p>I will beat the dog shit outta you in Detroit."The bars in question on "Chloraseptic" were interpreted by many to be a stab at all the critics who reacted negatively to Revival."Not as raw as I was, 'Walk on Water' sucks,' Bitch, suck my dick/ Y'all saw the tracklist and had a fit 'fore you heard it/ So you formed your verdict/ While you sat with your arms crossed/ Did your little reaction videos and talked over songs (Chill!)/ Nah, dog, y'all sayin' I lost it, your fuckin' marbles are gone."But Bizarre laid out a deeper timeline of grievances with Budden and seemingly confirmed Eminem's verse was specifically calling out Budden, referencing comments made before Revival dropped via Everday Struggle and The Joe Budden Podcast.</p><p>Cent, who's never one to shy away from any negativity directed at Slim Shady, also chimed in on the situation."That was a bad idea, look you got a little ass whopping coming," he wrote in an Instagram post about Budden. "It’s not a big deal, you will get over it."Budden doesn't appear to be worried, telling one Twitter user that he "lives for this."</p></div>
