  <h1>Atlantic Records Complaint Sends Major Blog Twitter Accounts Into Suspension</h1>

  <div class="content"><p>The latest round of DMCA takedowns is further illustrating something we've dealt with personally in the past: the thin line between media and piracy.</p><p>Today, some massive blogs were suspended on Twitter following a -- "supposedly" -- mistaken DMCA complaint from Atlantic records surrounding the publishing of a Young Thug tracklisting.</p><p>It's far from the first time such a thing has happened, but it's one of the more widespread situations, involving sites like Pigeons And Planes, Fader, and more.

In the past, we've also faced similar reprimands from networks like Facebook and Twitter, which is frustrating as a media outlet who spends the majority of their time delivering promotion for artists.</p><p>Many of the mechanisms in place that prevent the general public from sharing and streaming copyrighted content should -- in some cases -- be amended for the press -- in our opinion.</p><p>We've personally had situations where sharing content shared directly from artists /labels/management has led to heavy-handed discipline and a ton of headaches.</p><p>All something like this does is sour blogs from covering Young Thug in the future, in fear that a potential social downtime situation could negatively impact any partnerships or obligations on the part of sponsored content.</p><p>We are <em>not</em> your enemy!</p></div>
