  <h1>DJ Quik & Problem – Rosecrans</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Surprise albums have become a the staple marketing strategy of the past 365, which has been quite exciting -- for the most part.</p><p>The latest out of nowhere release came this week from legendary Compton OG, DJ Quik, and buzzing CPT native Problem with their joint EP, Rosecrans.</p><p>The name is a nod to Rosecrans Avenue, the main street that runs through several cities including Compton and Hawthorne in south Los Angeles County.</p><p>Much like the infamous street, the project's lead song, "A New Nite/ Rosecrans Grove," is long and varied, clocking in at just over 9 minutes in length.</p><p>It features thick, west coast production you've come to appreciate from Quik over the years, with a host of video-game inspired elements infused.</p><p>The track, which was my highlight of the EP -- BTW -- almost comes off as a jam session instrumentally.</p><p>Lyrically, both artists give exactly what you'd expect; no surprises, but no disappointments, either.</p><p>The Game, Wiz Khalifa, Candice Boyd and more appear throughout the concise six-song effort delivering strong bars.</p><p>This is top down, real-deal, summertime west coast hip-hop, coming from one of the most respected rappers in the history of the city.</p><p>From his 15-year on wax beef with MC Eiht to his work with the West's upper echelon, Quik has never really put out anything that wasn't solid -- in my humble opinion.</p><p>And if you haven't been following the upward trajectory of rapper Problem, it's not too late to get on the train.</p><p>These two rappers gel so well together that's hard to imagine we won't hear more from them as a duo.</p><p>Give Rosecrans a spin; it gets two W's up.</p><p>Early.
