Over the radio-ready instrumental, D-Brown's gruff cadence comes with the straight talk for the ladies and juxtaposes with the smooth as silk melody on the chorus and Mannish Mania's back to back bars.</p><p>D-Brown tells AAHH “I’m making trap music with a message and not just mumbling anything behind a trap beat." The quality of this single is an exciting look at what he has in the cannon ready to pop.</p></div>
