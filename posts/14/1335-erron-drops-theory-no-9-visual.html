  <h1>Erron Drops 'Theory No. 9' Visual</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sat, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>EsZ—also known as Erron—is a rapper and visual artist from New York City that has been featured here on AAHH hip-hop; albeit it's a been a while since we've heard from him.</p><p>We were excited to get some new music from him. "Theory No. 9" is interesting for a few reasons; first of all, the title of the song suggests that it may not be factual.</p><p>Secondly, the sheer concept (song and video) follows the protagonist—assuming he's speaking as himself—as he's seemingly talking to a love interest.</p><p>An audio text message of sorts.</p><p>That's a side story, though.</p><p>He's developed a dependency to pills, which was picked up after an accident, which led to a heap of setbacks with which he—as an artist—is coping with; "art helps heal what the pills just won't."

As always with Erron, the quality and uniqueness are there—and the story element pulls you in.</p><p>Check out the record below, and if you're feeling, knock on the share button.
