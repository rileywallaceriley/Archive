  <h1>#IndieSpotlight: MusicbyKO "Life In Element" Is The Soundtrack For Pre-Fall Blues</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>A new LP floated across my desk by an Oakland, California, singer/rapper named MusicbyKO.</p><p>A warm blend of jazzy 90s Hip Hop and a cadence reminiscent of acts like Isaiah Rashad.</p><p>Having shared stages with names like J.I.D. and Earthgang, he appears focused and composed -- as evidenced by <em>Life In Element</em>, his new LP.

With a very consistent sound, KO slowly unravels a series of tracks that let you into his world just enough -- without blatant TMI, or inducing a "yeah right" effect.</p><p>What listeners get are the tales of a low-level drug dealer (this is both referenced and downplayed at different points), who is taking a chance on a dream, as he slowly but surely uncovers that everything the glimmers isn't gold, and just because someone calls you brother, it doesn't mean they have your back -- or at the very least even your best interests at heart.</p><p>It's an almost paranoid sense that snakes are roaming the grass that is revisited numerous times throughout the project, like on the song "La La Land," "Empathy," and "Let Me Talk With Ya/While I'm Here," where he notes "I Know niggas right now that want to see me fall."

He also paints a picture of himself as someone who overextends himself -- such as on "Too Much Falls Short," where he preaches that failing to leave your comfort zone is a fail before even leaving the running block.</p><p>That's just the first few layers of this project; touching on socio-economic issues facing the black community nationwide, and even relationships (see the super dope "Spirit Rise"), he creates a lot of depth.</p><p>Though the vibe is consistent -- almost bordering on redundant -- it manages to remain engaging.</p><p>Also, that instrumental on "A Devil's Advocate Corner" is a bucket of flame emojis doused in gasoline.


&amp;nbsp;
Like a bride on her wedding day, <em>Life In Element</em> is something old and something new; all that Hip Hop is dead shit goes out teh window when you hear younger cats with cohesive projects like this.</p><p>With enough amazing quotables to create a success Instagram daily quote account ("I couldn't heal in eth place I got sicker") and an admirable ear for production, MusicbyKO NEEDS to be on your radar.</p><p>It's just good for the soul.</p><p>Early.</p></div>
