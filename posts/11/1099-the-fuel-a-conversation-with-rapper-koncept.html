<p class="p1"><strong>How did you get into hip-hop originally?</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I grew up in Queens New York.</p><p>My next-door neighbor was a graffiti artist, and when my parents used to go out, they’d have him watch me.</p><p>He got me into drawing and writing graffiti, and he gave me the name Koncept when I was 7.</p><p>What my parents didn’t know back then is that they would go out, and he would take me out writing with him sometimes.</p><p>So my first time I ever went out writing I was like seven years old.</p><p>At age 11 I got my first turntables, which I still have – and still use.</p><p>You know, I always liked writing.</p><p>I wrote short stories and poetry.</p><p>I used to freestyle for fun.</p><p>I'd have a microphone that I plugged into my mixer, and I'd freestyle for fun when I was hanging out with friends and stuff like that; but, then when I started to write raps it was like I instantly fell in love.</p><p>I got hooked and stopped doing everything else.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">I read before that you DJ.</p><p>You don’t call yourself a DJ, but you have tables, you’ve had them for a long time, and you’re probably pretty good. </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I used to watch DMC tapes, all the Scratch DVD’s and the Beat Junkies DVD; I loved scratching, like Q-Bert and all that.</p><p>It’s funny, I was in my parent’s house about a week ago, and I was looking through some old stuff and I found some old CDs and cassette tapes.</p><p>I was listening to some things that I did – and I was like, “This shit is dope!” .</p><p>I was like, “Maybe I should start scratching on my stuff some more.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">I mean, look at Lord Finesse, he almost exclusively DJ's and produces now.</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Do you see yourself doing something like that in the future?</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No, I don’t think that I’ll ever do that.</p><p>I have been thinking about doing some things — like maybe at shows in the middle of a set I’ll just sort of stop and then go behind the turntables and start scratching and cutting up records.</p><p>Just do it as a surprise, you know what I mean?</p><p>Because again, a lot of people don’t know about it so I think that would be something cool to add to the shows.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">You could start the set like that.</p><p>Be the warm-up DJ, and then you just come out, no one would expect it at all.</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yeah, exactly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">So maybe talk a little bit about Brownbag All-Stars.</p><p>How did you get involved in the group?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I think it was 2007.</p><p>As a DJ, I’ve always bought records at Fat Beats, since the time that I got my turntables.</p><p>One day I went in there to get some records.</p><p>I walked in and J-57, who used to go by J-Logic, was playing beats in the store, <span class="s1">and there were people rapping over them.</p><p>I jumped into the cipher and started rapping.</p><p>That’s how I and J met.</p><p>We started talking; we exchanged phone numbers, and he sent me some beats.</p><p>We became friends, and he got me the job at Fat Beats.</p><p>Working at Fat Beats, there was a bunch of other employees, and it turns out that we formed our group called Brownbag All-Stars.</span></span>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">That’s crazy.</p><p>Tell me about the new EP and the process of putting it together.</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I dropped my solo album titled, “<em>Awaken</em>” in 2012, alongside a handful of music videos.</p><p>One day, I got an email from Red Bull.</p><p>They said that they found my music and wanted to bring me on as a Red Bull artist.</p><p>I thought I was pretty crazy because, at that time, Red Bull was mainly in the extreme sports world.</p><p>I was like, “Wow, Red Bull!</p><p>That’s insane.” So I agreed, and a couple days later I got a big box of Red Bull . </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They (Red Bull) hit me up and asked me if I wanted to be in this contest where they took all the people that they had as artists, and people would vote for their favorite artist – and the winner of this contest would get studio time down in LA.</p><p>I ended up winning the competition.</p><p>That was at the same time that J-57 and I were already talking about working on the next album where he was going to produce it all, and it was going to be all sample-free.</p><p>So when we got this opportunity, we decided to be a group like a Gang Starr.</p><p>You know, like Primo and Guru or like Blu and Exile.</p><p>We just wanted a project where he produces the whole thing, and I do all the vocals on it.</p><p>So they flew us down to LA, and we worked on the album.</p><p>The album is called, “<em>Flight</em>” that is going to come out in 2016.</p><p>We did the album, and our aim was just to make the best music of our lives.</p><p>We finished the album, and the following week we were already sitting down with major labels.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was just a big turning point for us because we knew that we had made the best music that we’ve ever made, but we didn’t know, I guess, the extent of where it could go.</p><p>So we took those meetings and all that, and then we flew back to New York, and that’s when we decided to record an EP to be the precursor to the album.</p><p>So we recorded "<em>The Fuel</em>.&amp;nbsp;</span><span class="s1">In that period, we had some offers from major labels and decided not to go that route and do it on our own.</p><p>So that’s what we’ve been building.</p><p>We’ve been building Kon 57 records for basically the last year and a half, two years.</p><p>Now we’re getting ready to launch on November 20th and couldn’t be more excited about it.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">What kind of propelled your choice to not go with a major label?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You know, everything that we built has been in our control, we’ve done it on our own.</p><p>We worked at Fat Beats — J worked there for 5 or 6 years, I worked there for like 3 ½, 4&amp;nbsp;years – and, you know, we built Brown Bag on our own, and we built our solo stuff on our own.</p><p>We've done our own marketing, and done our own PR and booking.</p><p>Honestly, we've worked almost every part of this industry.</p><p>We've worked so hard on it, that to basically hand it over to a label and not be in full control was just something that we didn’t feel would be right and worth all this work that we’ve been putting in.</p><p>So we know that it’s more work, obviously doing it on our own, but in the long run, it’s better.</p><p>We’re in full control, have all rights to everything, and nobody is going to be telling us how to make the music or when to put the music out.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">So is it essentially a label?&amp;nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I mean, it is a label.</p><p>We’re not signing any other artists or putting any other artists on; it’s just to put our stuff out.</p><p>Hopefully in the future we get to a point that we’re at that we can help other artists out and put them on but for right now it’s just for our music.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">What’s your take on the current music scene in New York City?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I think that the music industry now is lot stronger than it has been in recent years.</p><p>I think that everything is looking good, and there are a lot of talented artists, a lot of avenues and a lot of people that are doing the right thing for it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Who are some of the artists that you’re checking for right now? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Joey Badass, Action Bronson...</p><p>As far as New York artists.</p><p>And of course, you have Fetty Wap everywhere.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Yeah, he’s everywhere..</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He’s from the East Coast, can’t hate on that from my end.</p><p>I’ll be honest: I didn’t know that he was from Jersey when I first started hearing him. .</p><p>But it’s dope that he is.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Do you have any last words at all you’d like to share with our blog?</p><p>Anything else we should be looking out for from you guys?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I mean, we’re going to have the second single coming out in the next week or two, and we have the video for that. “<em>The Fuel EP</em>” drops November 20th and we’re excited.</p><p>You can pre-order on iTunes right now.</p><p>The video for “<em>Porcelain</em>” is out.</p><p>It just broke 100,000 views, which is insane.</p><p>I can’t thank everybody enough.</p><p>And yeah, we’re just excited.</span></p>
