    <div class="meta">2018-12-07 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Since being discovered by singer Bobby Valentino, bubbling southern artist Chris Landry has been vying for the role of Houston’s next break out star. With two projects under his belt in the past 365 — Sacrifice and Pain — the rapper/singer is lining himself up for success in 2019.His latest single and video, “Where We Came From,” is the first single from his upcoming release, Sacrifice 2.</p>
<p>As Landry tells HipHopDX, it’s just him telling his story.“Like, you don’t even have to be from where I’m from to feel my pain and the story,”he says. It relates to everybody that comes from a neighborhood like mine ... they can take my words and switch it to the names of people they know and it’s still gon make sense.”Having been cleared of a murder charge this year, the open book new single is a fitting end to what can only be described as a rough 2018. “This past year I’ve been confined to only Harris county ... couldn’t do shows or anything based on lies/rumors etc,” he wrote via Instagram. “One thing I’ve learned through all these trials and tribulations is that you can’t tear down wat God built. “No matter wat thru it all wen you in these streets you gotta remain SOLID no matter what another mf saying,” he adds.Bobby V tells HipHopDX why he thinks Landry has next. “He got a unique sound and his drive is unmatched,” he says. “He really built his following and career from absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>No team, no label, and no budget. And he has a story to tell.”Check out Chris Landry’s “Where I’m From,” above. [apple_news_ad type="standard"]</p></div>
