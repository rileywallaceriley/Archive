  <h1>Nicki Minaj Says “Barbie Dreams” Only Rubbed 1 Person Wrong</h1>
  <div class="meta">2018-08-14 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Nicki Minaj made an appearance on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert last night (August 14) to discuss her new LP, Queen.</p><p>During the 10-minute segment, she spilled a little bit of tea on her personal reactions to "Barbie Dreams," the record that recently went viral."Only one person got a little irritated, but I explained to him how much I love him and he understands now," she says, without naming any names. “He was texting me…it was kind of a combination between cursing me out and laughing at it,” Minaj added, noting that she pacified him with crying face emojis.There's a good chance Nicki is either referring to her ex-lover Meek Mill, who was trending on every social media platform upon the song's release or Young Thug, who publicly responded to his inclusion on the track.</p><p>When asked how she would address Colbert -- who the host jokingly pointed out was not on the list of men she raps about -- Minaj was quick to offer four bars off the top:"I might fuck Stephen after the show, he might come back to work with a magical glow ... but when you see us muthafucka please don't stare, just address me as Queen Nicki Colbert."The song itself, is a remake of the Notorious B.I.G.'s "Dreams," which was later commercially released with the name "Just Playin (Dreams)." In the song, Biggie calls out the list of women he would -- and wouldn't -- have sex with.</p><p>Most notably, he dissed Xscape, only to later apologize.</p></div>
