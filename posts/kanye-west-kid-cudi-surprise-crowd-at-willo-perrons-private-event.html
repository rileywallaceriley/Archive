To the excitement of the attendees, Ye brought out Kid Cudi for an impromptu set in celebration of the 10th anniversary of Perron's agency, Willo Perron & Associates.The crowd at Los Candiles Night Club were treated to -- among other things -- a live rendition of "Ghost Town."Footage shared via Instagram shows the duo also performing songs like "Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1." and Yeezy classic "Can't Tell Me Nothing." None of the footage appears to show them performing any tracks off of Kid's See Ghosts.Perron and West have a tenured history of collaborating.</p>
<p>Working on designing live shows, video, interiors, installations, and print media, Perron has also worked with names like Rihanna, JAY-Z -- notably on his 4:44 tour -- Kendrick Lamar, Lady Gaga, The Weeknd, Drake, and much more.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG-LLgLPs0gKanye and Cudi are set to do their first performance as Kids See Ghosts, headlining for the seventh annual Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival set to take place November 10-11 at the Dodgers Stadium in Los Angeles, California.[apple_news_ad type="standard"]</p></div>
