  <h1>Konscious – As Long As They Know</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Born in Forthworth, Texas, 23-year-old MC, Konscious, is going for broke.</p><p>Growing up in New Jersey, his Dominican/Colombian background has given his music a unique edge –one that the music industry hasn't heard yet.</p><p>His range is illustrated in his most recent latest full-length project, <i>BORED</i>, which dropped last year.</p><p>He is a blend of heavy street music, introspective boom bap, and bar heavy, golden era consciousness.</p><p>A focused listen to his music truly paints a vivid picture of his environment – and his desire to leave the streets behind him to take his music to the next level.</p><p>With the catalogue I heard on his Soundcloud, it seems like he's destined for great things.</p><p>It's similar to the feeling I had when I first started bumping Max B and French Montana; Konscious has a bright future.</p><p>Take an ear to his latest single, the unapologetically trap single, <i>As Long As They Know</i>, featuring Dre Brown.</p><p>I'll add a few other gems after the jump!</p><p>Early.
