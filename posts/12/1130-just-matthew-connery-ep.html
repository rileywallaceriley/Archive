– Just Matthew</blockquote>
The backdrop of palm trees and the sunshine has long given birth to some of the industry's most talented voices – and rightfully so.</p><p>The region's mixture of realities that range from carefree beachfront living, plastic Hollywood dreaming, and circles of gang violence, LA has given us a broad variety of artists from all genres and mediums.</p><p>Just Matthew is one such artist to emerge from the golden glow of Cali.</p><p>At just 24 years of age, this rapper, singer and songwriter has developed a strong, confident style and sound that has him primed to take things to the next level.</p><p>Just Matthew's latest project, the four-song EP <i>Connery</i>, is an excellent example of his range and capabilities as an artist.</p><p>The lead song, <i>Forget</i>, has a laid back summery vibe that matches the Cali weather.</p><p>With an almost Drake-esque (in a good way) flow, he bobs and weaves from singing to rapping, delivering a radio-ready performance that leaves a great first impression. <i>Prototype</i> sees him dig deeper beneath the surface as he embraces imperfections, and lets listeners know that he is indeed a work in progress – and his hunger to grow is the raw element that fuels his sound. <i>Understand It</i>, and <i>Bonnie</i>, both have Matthew showing off his flow, which sparkles throughout the EP.</p><p>Produced entirely by MKSB, the project sounds cohesive sonically, while still managing to deliver four songs that allow Matthew to show four different sides of himself.</p><p>Just Matthew's music is very current, catchy honest and personal.</p><p>He's an artist to keep your eyes and ears on this year.</p><p>Listen to his four-track EP below.
