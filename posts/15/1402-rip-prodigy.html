  <h1>RIP Prodigy</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Another one!</p><p>Today Hip Hop lost a real soldier of the game, Albert Johnson -- better known as Prodigy.</p><p>Half of the infamous Queens duo Mobb Deep, 42-year-old Prodigy was the epitome of the Hip Hop that real heads loved.</p><p>He was really about that street shit, he came up in an era where skills reigned supreme, and he had a distinctive vocal tone and way with words that will ultimately help uphold his legacy, which is an untouchable catalog.</p><p>Over the course of his epic career, Prodigy worked with some of the most prominent architects in modern Hip Hop culture.</p><p>From the hand, Q-Tip played in Mobb's classic sophomore album, to his work with Nas during the Illmatic era -- all the way to his later amalgamation with the G-Unit team -- P has been traversing the game for well over 25 years.</p><p>More importantly, he never left his core audience or compromised his integrity, even in the face of the ever-changing landscape of the music industry.</p><p>Sidebar, if you haven't read his book, punch yourself in the face.</p><p>He's very vocally suffered from Sickle Cell Anemia all his life, and it appears complications from the disorder ultimately led to his death.</p><p>This is a monumental loss, though.</p><p>At the moment I find it hard to write with a clear head, as P was truly one of my favourite rappers of all times.</p><p>RIP, Dun.
