  <h1>A New Day: Hodgy Steps Out With His Solo Debut</h1>

  <div class="content"><p><blockquote>"I am a wizard, an illusionist.</p><p>I am a dreamer in a dream without a society.</p><p>I am Hodgy."
--Hodgy</blockquote>
Odd Future--although dope--always felt a little too young for me.</p><p>I entered high school in 96-97, so while they were a breath of fresh air and a middle finger to the polished more business-oriented major releases running the day, I never fully 'committed' to them.</p><p>Because, while I loved and recognized their obvious significance, it felt a little too immature, for lack of a better term.</p><p>My initial instincts about their importance was obviously correct, no need to bore you.</p><p>But, like  groups of youngsters who blow fast  and go zero to a hundred real quick, they experienced understandable turmoil, and eventually--via the Twitter fingers of Tyler The Creator--the group was officially disbanded.</p><p>But, for one-time member Hodgy Beats, who now simply goes by Hodgy, it's a new day.</p><p>With the experience behind him, and a wealth of opportunity ahead of him, Hodgy is finally stepping out on his own with his official debut, <em>Fireplace: The NotTheOtherSide</em>; it's a stark departure from everything you think you know about him as an artist and person.</p><p>Framed around a conversation with his  mother, the project is the 26-year-old's coming of age, in a way, exploring themes that range from forgiveness to mortality, co-parenting and more.</p><p>He seems woke, shedding his past, and soaring towards new skies.</p><p>No shock value, no antics, just bars, surprisingly amazing production, and only three features—so, he's basically out on the ledge himself.&amp;nbsp;

The first single/video "Barbel" is a renaissance track that asserts his hunger and his focus, while the 88-Keys produced "<a href=" Hour</a>" and BADBADNOTGOOD produced "<a href=" Beat</a>" sees the young rapper holding his own alongside superstars Busta Rhymes and Lil' Wayne, respectively.</p><p>Holding his own is an understatement—even without the star power, this project holds up.</p><p>Highlights for me were "<a href=" which is a concept built upon a one-way conversation with God, and the jazzy relationship-themed record "<a href=" which has been playing back in my head for days.</p><p>Full disclosure, I've been playing this album on repeat for the last week.</p><p>This album seemed very personal at points—as though he alot to get off of his chest.</p><p>It's a strong first 'solo' effort, and does a great deal to really re-brand Hodgy as his own rapper, outside of the OF shadow.</p><p>It's only the beginning, though.</p><p>I heard through the grapevine that he has a collaborative album in the works with Nelly Furtado, amongst other things.</p><p>He's still incredibly young; chances are, we'll be seeing a lot more of Hodgy in the years to come.</p></div>
