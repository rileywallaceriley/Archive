  <h1>Charles Hamilton's Debut Is A Glorious Comeback</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Two particular lines stood out to me as I listened to the latest record from Charles Hamilton.</p><p>On the first track, he confidently and coyly harps, "I had a hot start; label tried to make me a pop star—they wanted an album, and I made art." Second, a few songs later, he pleads, "don't laugh at my sadness...I'm predisposed to it." This artistry and obvious emotional instability perfectly sum up the  enigma that is Charles Hamilton, the Harlem-world resident who after heaps of promise and notoriety finally released his self-titled major label debut this month (via Republic).</p><p>With a few exceptions, the project is densely packed with substance, personality, and a gambit of themes that range from race in America ( on "Correct"), depression, his own (very public) demons, and more.</p><p>Charles, who likely holds a record with two debut albums shelved (although leaked), did a lot to distinguish himself on this project, which is something new fans will be able to appreciate, as it gives an entry point to this complicated emcee.</p><p>He opens up about everything, from his struggles overcoming depression and isolation to the incident where he punched a cop.</p><p>On the less-reflective and more savage outro, "Stay There," he acknowledges some of his more controversial criticisms.</p><p>Namely, his ill-fated attempt to help Dilla's mother out by crediting him as executive producer of his shelved project and his viral spat with Ex-girlfriend, Briana.</p><p>Some of the highlights I found were "Only Christina Knows," a heartbreaking ode to the woman that he described as keeping him alive and making his life complete, and the piano-driven "Man's World." I didn't care for "Be With You" it seemed uninspired and out of place to me.</p><p>Having done some—obviously reparable—damage to his career while reeling from addiction and undiagnosed bipolar disorder, it was exciting to see him picking up steam (again) with his Rita Ora-assisted "New York Raining" which appeared on "Empire." Coming into the fold during the bubble of time where Cudi and Lupe were starting to make names for themselves, Charles is a true artist—this music is clearly more therapeutic than anything.</p><p>His overly clear enunciated bars, which may put some newer fans in mind of Odd Future's Sweatshirt Earl, are heavy as hell—worth a place on your playlist if you're into music that has some heart and soul to it.</p></div>
