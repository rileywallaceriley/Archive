  <h1>Current Obsession: Torii Wolf X DJ Premier</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Have you ever wondered what eccentric Icelandic singer Björk would sound like over the heavy snared boom-bap hip-hop sound of the great DJ Premier?</p><p>Well, you don't have to start combing Google for a unicorn DJ blend that doesn't exist -- instead take a listen to Primo's cool new artist, Torii Wolf.</p><p>Their wicked new song "1st," is a blend of (almost) gloomy/haunting, ambient sounds you'd expect from someone like Adele, mixed cuts and a piano driven beat from Primo himself.</p><p>Torii, who Preme lovingly referred to as "weird in a good way" in a press release, has an upcoming album called <i>&amp;nbsp;Flow Riiot, </i>coming down the pipe, produced entirely by the famed hip-hop DJ.</p><p>In the meantime, the single "1st" not only has a video, but a remix she recently dropped featuring the LA duo of Evidence and Rakaa, better known as the Dilated Peoples.</p><p>If you're not sold -- trust Premier 's ear.</p><p>Torii is the first female artist to have an album entirely produced by him, which is a big deal!</p><p>Get situated with her sound, and stay tuned as we'll bring you more in her album soon!
