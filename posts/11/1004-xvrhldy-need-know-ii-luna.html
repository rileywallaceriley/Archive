A few months ago, <a title="XVRHLDY: The New Sound Of Chi-Town" href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/xvrhldy-new-sound-chi-town/">I interviewed a cat by the name of XVRHLDY</a>.</p><p>I even went as far as to proclaim him as the new sound of Chicago – which is a pretty big cosign considering the city's musical roots.</p><p>To explain, I find him incredibly refreshing.</p><p>His music seems to blend in and innovate simultaneously, that is to say, it doesn't slap you in the face with blatant oddity, like say Outkast , nor does it seamlessly fit into the trap sound that currently rules the city's main arteries.</p><p>His latest release, <em>Need To Know II: Luna</em>, is a big win on a few fronts.</p><p>It satisfies his core, who were open off of joints like <em><a href=" and his <a href="http://xvrhldy.bandcamp.com/releases">original tape</a>, but also breaks some new commercial ground.</p><p>The latter point is important, because I'm tired of telling people they are sleeping on this kid.</p><p>For the most part, <em>Luna</em> sticks to the formula (not a bad thing).</p><p>His production ranges from a "riding around at night" vibe on tracks like <em>Road Trips </em>and the aggressively flowed <em>Noctuno to a</em> smoothed-out vibe on tracks like <em>Black Alablaster</em> and <em>The Root part II</em> (part one had a <a href=" visual treatment</a>).</p><p>The standouts here for me were the L.A VanGogh produced <em>New To Me</em>, and his brilliantly executed <em>Marthié François Girbaud</em>, in which he lyrically <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">reminisces</span> time travels back to 1996, to revisit block life and then to 2006 to relive a run-in with Chicago law enforcement.</p><p>There's also the head nodding <em>True Enough</em>, which is the closest to a literal love song you're going get here.<em> Every Story Ever Told</em>  is also getting serious burn here at the office!
<blockquote>"Globally, those memories that are best live through the morning.</p><p>LUNA is a tale of one of those nights."

One of the things that struck me about from my <a title="XVRHLDY: The New Sound Of Chi-Town" href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/xvrhldy-new-sound-chi-town/">original conversation with X</a> was that he had a great game plan, and this project does a great job of reaffirming that.</p><p>On <em>Need To Know II: Luna</em>, Xavier avoids overly experimenting outside of his trademark sound, and rather delivers a solid, consistent project that flows from start to finish.</p><p>Ironically that actually makes for an insanely innovative product.</p><p>The insanely catchy <em>Hammana</em> sounds like a radio banger too, so hopefully heads who have been sleeping on this cat wake the f– up and smell the deep dish.</p><p>Chicago is in the building.
