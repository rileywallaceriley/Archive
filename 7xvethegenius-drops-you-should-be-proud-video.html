Love is calm, love is aggressive and love is playful and upbeat.</p>
<p>But, love is also a real feeling and connection to the soul," she explains."That's everything I wanted this project to invoke ... all of the feelings of what love is or is perceived to be."Watch 7xvethegenius's "You Should Be Proud" video above.
