  <h1>Tony Touch Celebrates 20th Anniversary Of 50 MCs</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sat, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I'm always blindsided but lengthy milestones.</p><p>That's part of getting older, though.</p><p>I remember like it was yesterday, being a young cat at summer Caribbean street festivals copping mixtapes (like actual tapes) from local and out of town vendors.</p><p>One day I came across a cassette from a name I'd heard before, Tony Touch.</p><p>The tape in question was the first instalment of the illustrious Power Cypher series, better known as the 50 MC's.</p><p>I spent that evening blown out, wearing down my rewind button, trying to memorize quotes.</p><p>Apparently, that was 20 years ago – ouch!</p><p>The tapes featured three volumes, and a who's who of golden era New York City artists, most in their 90's prime, dropping freestyles – at various levels of off the top-ness.</p><p>The sheer coordination of all 150 original freestyles, is a work of art.</p><p>With the added touch (no pun intended) of actual turntablism, these tapes stand as a time capsule that represents a particular segment of not just my life, but that of many heads that grew up within the bubble of 90's hip-hop.</p><p>It's a humbling listen.</p><p>Next to 5 Fingaz Of Death, it stands collectively as my fave mixtape of all-time.

Now, a seemingly distant twenty years later, Tony is planning to celebrate the milestone with live dates and parties throughout the summer.</p><p>In the meantime, we've compiled all three instalments here for you to jam – complete with the tracklisting.</p><p>Random thought if there were to be a 2016 instalment of 50 MCs, who do you think could make the cut?</p><p>Hit us on Twitter and let us know.
