  <h1>Sean Price – Songs in the Key of Price</h1>

– Sean Price</blockquote>
<em><a href=" in the key of life</a></em> was a milestone in the legendary career of the inspiring Mr.</p><p>Stevie Wonder.</p><p>Heralded by many – to this day – as his best album, it was a culmination/climax of his pre-commercial musical career, referred to mainly as his "classic period." With this in mind, Sean Price’s ode (cover wise) to the classic album, <em><a href="https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCAQFjAAahUKEwj54a2Oz9bHAhWLWpIKHaKGA54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fsongs-in-the-key-of-price%2Fid1023504250&amp;usg=AFQjCNH4c_FdmTgE7K_8h0TTNamJOwhGQw&amp;sig2=bFC4YiBWK_0mEeurghKMDg&amp;bvm=bv.101800829,d.dmo">Songs in the Key of Sean Price</a></em>, seems eerily appropriate.</p><p>Announced shortly before his death, the un-intended posthumous release has two versions available to fans: an 8 track digital version available on I-tunes, and a 30 track mixtape/version, cut up by longtime friend, collaborator and DJ, DJ PF Cuttin. .</p><p>We had a pre-order in, and after anxiously checking the mailbox daily since it shipped on the 21st, it finally arrived yesterday and has been bumping hard ever since.

<em>"Listen to his catalogue – and his jokes, his vulgarities and all his slap the shit out you isms, and enjoy all of it.</p><p>He epitomized the term not giving a fuck – and being yourself in the truest form.”</em>

The release is incredibly solid – and sure to satisfy old and new fans alike.</p><p>It has all the characteristics of a P project: it’s vicious, no holds barred, gutter, humorous and full of quotable lines.</p><p>No filler either!</p><p>Just heat, from the opener, the booming Bobby MC Bars and the 70’s drug-dealer flows on Fei Long, to the ‘in your face’ Planet Apes, and the release closer, Ni**erific – a the flip of the Cool Rob G classic Court In Session.</p><p>Featured verses come from the likes of Ike Eyes, Ill Ghee, Head Ice, Vic Spencer and Royal flush.</p><p>Regardless if Sean has a ton of material stacked up and ready to go, this project will always serve as the last release that he knowingly released – and in my opinion, he went out strong.</p><p>The project was worth the wait, and more than delivered on expectations.</p><p>The love, as usual, is in the details.</p><p>The beats are hard; the bars require multi-listens.</p><p>Even the album itself are listed (on iTunes and Spotify) as being released on “Ruck Down Records” – a nice “Easter egg” for real heads.</p><p>Rock said it best during our interview last week, through and through his music is all him.</p><p>Sean Price was a unique soul, and I’m will be a blueprint for a whole new generation of artists who seem to be shedding the conventions of the commercial shackles and wandering down the “indie-brick-road”.</p><p>This album is a MUST OWN for any and all P fans – and I implore you: if you haven’t fully taken in his catalog, please do so.</p><p>I’ll end this piece the same he ended this project: “P!”
