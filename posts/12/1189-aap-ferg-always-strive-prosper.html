  <h1>A$AP Ferg – Always Strive & Prosper</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>A lot has changed in the three years since the hood pope last left us with a collection of songs to knock.</p><p>For one, the A$AP team lost their rock, Yams, who died of a drug overdose in January of 2015.</p><p>Secondly, he’s gone back to his  roots in a major way, teaming up with Adidas to produce signature sneakers and gear; however, Ferg could only keep his day one fans waiting for so long.</p><p>With a significant buzz that began with the single/video "Next Level" featuring Future, his latest album <em>Always Strive &amp; Prosper</em> is here – and it’s full of surprises.</p><p>As a self-identified Ferg fan, the album has an unexpected aura to it.</p><p>Unlike his <i>Trap Lord</i> LP, <i>AS&amp;P</i> is much more introspective and personal.</p><p>He walks us through his past, gives us a look at his family, speaks openly about his relationship, and pays respect to his fallen comrade.</p><p>He sets the tone for the album on the second song – and first leak – “Hungry Ham,” a reference to his  OG stomping grounds of Hamilton Heights.</p><p>The Skrillex produced banger sees Ferg opening himself up and speaking on finite personal anecdotes, like his mother’s reaction to him dropping everything to rap.</p><p>He talks more about his family on the  “Psycho," where he breaks down his relationship with his gangster uncle, and the influence it had on him; the story continues seamlessly with the song “Let It Bang,’ featuring Schoolboy Q.



The surprises on this album, though, are his professions of love on “Let You Go,” and – the damn-near marriage proposal – “I Love You.” As well, his pro-positivity techno-infused dose of reality, "Strive" (featuring Missy), is bound to the song of the summer.</p><p>He also drops a very gentle/surface call to  action on “Beautiful People," and pays proper tribute to Yams on “Yammer Style,” which ends with (Yam’s) mother proclaiming that they are keeping his legacy alive.</p><p>After three solid listens to the 18 song effort, I feel as though I’m more into Ferg as a person; he gives listeners a chance to get to understand him a bit more clearly.</p><p>From fashion to rap, Ferg is ahead of the curve. <em>Always Strive &amp; Prosper</em> is a fantastic notch under his belt and a perfect start to the warm season.</p><p>Give it a bunch of spins!</p></div>
