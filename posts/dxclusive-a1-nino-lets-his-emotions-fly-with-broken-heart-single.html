    <h1>#DXCLUSIVE: A1 Nino Lets His Emotions Fly With "Broken Heart" Single</h1>
    <div class="meta">2019-03-26 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Following up his single "Part Of The Plan," which racked up over half a million plays on SoundCloud alone, Little Rock, Arkansas, native A1 Nino drops a visual for his new single "Broken Heart" -- a track that he says stems from personal experience.“I’m not a big talker, and I don’t argue, so I often have trouble expressing my emotions and [my girl] notices," he tells HipHopDX. "I can’t explain why I am the way I am, so I put my thoughts and pain into one song and talked about how we both have to deal with it."The song's subject matter is something Nino is banking will resonate with everyone who hears it. "Everyone has dealt with a broken heart whether it’s personal or dealing with someone else’s ... I feel like this song hits home with a lot of people, especially when they don’t know how to express how they feel inside," he says.The song is set to appear on a yet-to-be-titled project dropping later this year.
