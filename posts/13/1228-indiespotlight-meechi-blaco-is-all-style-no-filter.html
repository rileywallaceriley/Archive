  <h1>#IndieSpotlight: Meechi Blanco Is All Style No Filter</h1>

  <div class="content"><p><blockquote>"I don't want to be known as just a "rapper," I want to be more than that." —Meechi Blanco</blockquote>
A new project came across my desk today; State College, Pennsylvania, rapper Meechi Blanco is youthful, clever, nerdy, and all types of dope.</p><p>He describes his debut  release, good, as the dopest project we'll ever hear.</p><p>That's a pretty loaded statement, but it is an incredible entry to the young rapper.</p><p>Sitting at twelve tracks long, it has  feature, no filler, and tons of bars.</p><p>What immediately comes through is the youthful energy of the project.</p><p>He seems to capture that essence you may find with contemporary trap/cloud rappers like OG Maco for example, but with the substance, the knob turned up and then broken off and thrown into the brush outside the house.</p><p>Over incredible production like the slow-flow "Walter Blanco," the dark -- almost Wu-ish -- "Play My Tape Bitch," or the neck snapping "Creed," which was sadly way too short, Meechi shines.</p><p>Some highlights are the spacey "Trip," featuring vocals by DoctorWeedFairy, and the super hungry flow on "Piss Excellence."



Meechi is a one-man show -- from the engineering to the cover art. "I don't necessarily need to be rich, I just want to be able to do what I love to do and live comfortably," he says humbly.</p><p>That doesn't seem unreasonable; he sits outside the box, not so much by innovating per-say, but excelling by sticking to the basics.</p><p>That's hard to explain, and not as easy as it sounds. good, though, is -- in the end -- an ironic title, because this album is more than that.</p><p>He's relishing in the accomplishment, but not stopping to let the dust settle – he's already working on two follow-up projects scheduled to release in 2017.</p><p>Stay tuned to Meechi!</p><p>Early.
