    <h1>#DXCLUSIVE: X-Raided Releases Energetic “Get Off Me” Video</h1>
    <div class="meta">2019-08-07 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>As X-Raided celebrates the release of his long awaited 15th studio album California Dreamin’, the Sacramento rap legend has dropped a visual for the LP’s second single, “Get Off Me."“I made this one for the dancers,” X tells HipHopDX of the Mekanix-produced song. “It’s that traditional Northern California hyphy music for the streets and the club. I wanted the dancers to have something to swag out to, and we pulled it off.</p>
<p>Let’s have some fun for the summer!”After serving a 26-year prison sentence for murder, X was released in 2018. In an interview with DX this March, he explained the creation of his new 18-song LP was a dynamic journey that went from anger and defiance to acceptance and resolution — and (finally) to redemption and gratitude. “I’m hoping that I can set out a blueprint for anyone who’s thinking about making changes in their lives so that they’ll see that there is a path to take to do so.”Watch the Noble Cinema-directed video for “Get Off Me” above.</p></div>
