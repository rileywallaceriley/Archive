  <h1>Jedi Mind Tricks Return</h1>
  <div class="meta">Wed, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Some artists just keep it real – regardless of social and industry pressures.</p><p>It can mean the inevitable fall of group's who fail to play ball, so to speak; however some groups and artists thrive, and are able to remain fiercely independent.</p><p>A few examples that come to mind are RA The Rugged Man, most of the Def Jux roster and – of course – Jedi Mind Tricks.</p><p>The duo of Vinnie Paz and Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind (sans Jus Allah and DJ Kwestion) are back in action with a new album, <i>The Thief and the Fallen</i>.</p><p>On first skim, an avid JMT listener will notice that the album knocks.</p><p>It delivers what fans have come to expect from the brand: vicious bars from Vinnie and dope production. "I don't even rhyme to a beat, I fucking torcher it, like grabbing a butterfly and ripping the wings off of it..." laments Vinnie on the album opener <i>Poison In The Birthwater</i>.</p><p>That pretty much sums up the album's energy.</p><p>The album is relatively light on features.</p><p>Eamon – like the guy who sang <i><a href="https://youtu.be/QYwyaCd8MyI">Fuck It</a></i> back in the day – appears on two joints.</p><p>RA The Rugged Man joins Vinnie on the bar heavy <i>And God Said To Cain, </i>and Dialted Peoples trade verses with him on <i>The Kingdom That Worshipped The Dead</i>. <i>Hell's Messenger</i> and <i>Merchant Of War</i> are must-listens in my opinion.&amp;nbsp;

The album is 16 joints long, with an intro and atmospheric interlude included. <i>The Thief and the Fallen</i> is introspective, vicious and has a polished, self aware vibe you only get from vets like Vinnie and company.</p><p>Definitely worth a spin (or two)!
