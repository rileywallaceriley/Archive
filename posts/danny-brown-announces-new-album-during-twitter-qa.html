    <h1>Danny Brown Announces New Album During Twitter QA</h1>
    <div class="meta">2018-07-09 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>It appears Danny Brown is working on a new album. The Detroit rapper made the announcement via Twitter on Sunday (July 8) during a remarkably candid Q&A, which he entertained during a seven-hour flight.When Kickstarter's Director of Music Meredith Graves asked him why he suddenly became "the most entertaining person on twitter and/or ever," he replied, “I gotta new album coming."During a livestream on Instagram that same day, Brown noted he wanted to work with Alchemist on the as-of-yet untitled project.</p>
<p>Some fans thought he meant he was working exclusively with the Mobb Deep collaborator but that turned out not to be the case."I said I'm hoping to work with Al on this new album he's not producing the whole thing tho," Brown clarified.Although Brown mentioned the project is almost done, he told rapper Your Old Droog he had no idea when it was dropping. On Monday morning (July 9), he tweeted, “It’s not coming anytime soon.”During Brown's Twitter marathon, he answered questions about what it’s like being rich (he’s not) and why he never performs “Pac Blood” at his shows (he doesn’t know the words).Check out some more highlights from the Q&A below.
