    <h1>French Montana’s Tweet About “Musty Crusty Dusty Rusty Ass Hoe” Goes Left, To No One’s Surprise</h1>
    <div class="meta">2017-04-06 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>It all started with one tweet.Wednesday night, while cruising Twitter, user @artdecoxxx decided to voice her opinion on Bad Boy Entertainment rapper French Montana.What came next was unexpected, to say the least. The "I Ain't Worried" artist took particular offense to the tweet and set-off a mini PR meltdown.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it didn't go over too well for French.The conversation then went a few ways, with some immediately rushing to @artdecoxxx's side, while others questioned whether or not French went too far and whether or not he was racially entitled to make such comments — with some users calling him anti-black and culture vulture. French, seemingly against the ropes, not only defended his tweet, but reminded everybody of his ethnic background.Fans — for the most part — weren't buying it, even though some, including Philly rapper Tone Trump, came to his defense.</p>
<p>Interestingly, he didn't take the time to personally respond to the thousands of comments that ensued after the tweets. Still, some took a more lighthearted outlook on the whole situation.</p>
<p>It's still a mystery why French took particular offense to this one tweet, especially when searching "French Montana Sucks" on Twitter reveals many detractors. French obviously wasn't oblivious to the drama caused, and has since apologized — while still defending his initial tweet.</p>
<p>But, he ended with a pseudo-mic drop, "But on another note #STAYWOKE." French also addressed the issue with a call to The Breakfast Club.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coGEkUsDxeA"I don't know why they turned it to, like, a racist thing," he said. "There's other things to worry about that’s really racist out here in this country. I'm just defending myself.</p>
<p>You can't defend yourself out here no more?"He also commented on his use of "nappy," saying, "I ain't know 'nappy' was a racist word."In other French Montana news, he has a brand new video dropping soon that was filmed in Uganda.</p></div>
