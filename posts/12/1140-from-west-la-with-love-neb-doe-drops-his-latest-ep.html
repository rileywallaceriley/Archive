  <h1>From West LA With Love: Neb Doe Drops His Latest EP</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Today, the weather was unusually warm for winter; the sun came out this afternoon, as the city (of Toronto) hit a high of 50.</p><p>So, as I hit the street to make the most of this anomaly, I decided to give the homie Neb Doe a spin.</p><p>The West LA native's latest EP, "<i>3-2-1</i>," is the perfect blend of bassy low tempo goodness.</p><p>With influences that span from Wu-Tang Clan, Nas and Eminem, to Gorillaz, Kid Cudi and Mos Def, his approach to hip-hop is sonically innovative, without being so out of the box that he loses ears.</p><p>This project does an excellent job of speaking to what's in while hinting at what's next.</p><p>It kicks off with the soulful jazz saxophone driven "<i>Intro (Symphony 35)</i>," where Neb's love of film bubbles to the surface amidst film stock and camera angle references.</p><p>The sampled singer and echoey snaps on "<i>They Know</i>" create an atmospheric sound bed where Neb comes through with introspective – yet yolo-ish – live for the moment raps.</p><p>The piano-driven "<i>Oh My!</i>," and the Sister Sister sampled hook of <i>"Go Home Roger,"&amp;nbsp;</i>show off Neb's ear for production.</p><p>I was pleasantly surprised when I learned that all the beats were by entirely different producers, as they all have a cohesive feel.

<i>"3-2-1"</i> has a cinematic feel to it, making it ideal soundtrack music for your movements.</p><p>Neb is a wonderful example of the diversity the LA scene currently has to offer, especially with the Compton vibe dominating the airwaves.</p><p>This is perfect music to bump as the sun begins to hide in the horizon, and you're rolling through the city with your windows down.</p><p>Take an ear, and keep your eyes on Neb Doe!</p><p>West up!
