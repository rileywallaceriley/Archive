  <h1>RIP Sean Price</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sun, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I <i>hate</i> writing tribute or "memorial" pieces – and, unfortunately, this is the second one I've written in the past 30 days.</p><p>Like many, I learned yesterday that hip-hop lost yet another institution.</p><p>Hip-hop heavyweight Sean Price, much to the shock of many in the (worldwide) community, passed away in his sleep.</p><p>Most of the readers here don't need this, but I'm going to give a "little" background on P. He rose to prominence in the golden era of hip-hop as one-half of the group Heltah Skeltah.</p><p>The duo were prominent pillars of the supergroup Boot Camp Click .</p><p>P was also a member of Random Axe, but most notably – I think – he rebranded himself and focused on his solo career, releasing three full-length solo albums over the last decade.</p><p>If you need more than that, you probably should just Google him because you missed out.</p><p>Sean had many enviable qualities.</p><p>He was a rapper's rapper, by which I mean he had <i>serious</i> bars.</p><p>He came up in the golden era, and as everyone knows, times have changed.</p><p>That's an understatement.</p><p>The game is not the same.</p><p>It's a digital world, and hip-hop is very much a commercial endeavour.</p><p>Duck Down as a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">label</span> family seem to have done a fantastic job staying not only true to the craft but also relevant to their core audience.</p><p>Sean, as a solo artist, was especially great at it.</p><p>If you've ever watched any of his videos, you get it.</p><p>He was a funny dude.</p><p>He seemed like he didn't take himself too seriously.</p><p>He was also notorious for being an asshole online.</p><p>I'm not afraid to say he blocked us on Twitter ; however, when we pointed it out, we realized we weren't alone.</p><p>He blocked at will.</p><p>Posted at will – and off the cuff.</p><p>He didn't care what you thought.</p><p>Like, at all.</p><p>He didn't portray an image of a wealthy rapper lifestyle.</p><p>He was just an average guy – who happened to be a microphone bully.</p><p>This common man appeal and rock-star ego made him a fan favourite.</p><p>His down to earth qualities made him a revered member of the hip-hop community at large, and the inner circle of New York's underground (true school) scene.</p><p>He was a huge personality, and this is a huge loss for hip-hop.</p><p>Understand, I'm coming at this as a HUGE fan; although, reading some of the messages today from his peers, it's obvious that his big personality had made tremendous impacts on their lives.</p><p>He leaves behind a wife and three wonderful children.</p><p>Our deepest condolences – and prayers – go out to them.</p><p>RIP
