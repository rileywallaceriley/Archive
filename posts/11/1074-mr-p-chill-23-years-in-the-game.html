  <h1>Mr. P Chill: 23 Years In the Game</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"Never looked back from the day when he spit his first rap… He was hooked like a fiend, so much so that he never stopped chasing the dream” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Mr.</p><p>P Chill</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes passion takes sacrifice, hard work and dedication.</p><p>Without major label backing, it's ultimately up to the artists themselves how far they want to take their careers before they inevitably hang up the mic.</p><p>This is where the clear delineation between rappers and real artists becomes apparent, though.</p><p>While a "rapper" may shy away slowly when faced with lack of significant notoriety, or an uphill journey that just seems, well, hard – a true artist continues because he has no choice. Mr.</p><p>P Chill is one such artist.</p><p>Hailing from Sacramento, he's been doing the damn thing for over two decades. 23 years to be exact (he's 41 now).</p><p>He's a working artist in a real sense of the term.</p><p>He has a busy tour schedule, and literally (but more so <em>figuratively</em>) eats off of his music.</p><p>How many of you can say that?</p><p>Honestly?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">His latest effort, <em>Still Standing</em> is 12 joints long.</p><p>It showcases his honesty, determination, love of the culture, spirituality and, above all, his gratitude towards his fans and followers.</p><p>The one's that attend his shows across the nation – Currently, he tours the country .</p><p>There are some definite gems on this disc.</p><p>The title track lays out his 23-year journey in the game and solidifies his dedication to the culture of hip-hop.</p><p>The soulful <em>You Got Me</em> is an audio 'pound' to all his supporters who keep him going.</p><p>Other stand-outs here are the retrospective <em>Time Machine</em> and the introspective <em>Spiritual Journey</em>.</p><p>As well, the <i>Afro Puffs</i> flip on <em>You Got the Best of Me</em> is a must-listen. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He also has some surprising features here, like the rhyme inspector <a href="https://www.stonesthrow.com/perceep">Percee P</a> on the song <em>Veteran Status</em>, and Spyder D on the head nodding <em>No Regrets</em>.</p><p>Now for those who don’t know <a href="http://raprehab.com/some-hip-hop-history-with-spyder-d/">Spyder D</a>, he was the first rapper in history to release an independent record – making him (in a sense) the living/breathing mecca of indie rap.</p><p>Cool right?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mr.</p><p>P Chill genuinely enjoys what he does, and he’s dedicated his life to it.</p><p>This love comes across in his work. <em>Still Standing</em> is at once an excellent introduction to his catalogue and a salute to all those who have kept him metaphorically running over the past 23 years.</p><p>Give it a spin!</span></p>
