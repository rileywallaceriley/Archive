"Thanks again, Rugged ... from one head to another."That story ended up inspiring another man, named Alexander Peterson, to show up at a tour date to beatbox for R.A., who took to Twitter to share his excitement.“The other day I posted footage of a disabled man in a wheelchair beatboxing at my show ... so my next show in a completely different country fans brought another disabled man in a wheelchair to beatbox.”“I hope this is a new trend at my shows because it's a beautiful thing,” he added.</p><p>R.A.’s US tour, alongside A-F-R-O, kicks off June 4 in Rochester, New York.</p></div>
