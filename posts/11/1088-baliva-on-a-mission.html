  <h1>Baliva: On A Mission</h1>

—Baliva</blockquote>
I've said it before, but I'll echo that I have a lot to learn about the UK music scene.</p><p>I have to say, though, I'm always impressed with the level of talent I hear.</p><p>My latest find from across the pond is <a href="http://www.balivamusic.com/">Baliva</a>, a talented MC that wears his heart – and his faith in his sleeve.</p><p>Born in Harare, Zimbabwe, he moved to London in 2001 to study media production and throw himself entirely into his pursuit of his lifelong dream of becoming a successful hip-hop artist.</p><p>On his journey, though, he faced personal struggles that eventually – at his lowest – saw the young artist become Christian, and focus on using his talent for good.</p><p>His latest effort, <i>Imperfect</i>, is both culmination of this vision and a wonderful body of music.

<i>"Now people wanna act strange when you start to make a change but keep pressing on because my Lord will make you strong."</i>

<i>
</i><i>— Baliva</i>

Sonically the album has a blend of club/trap, backpack/street-hop, and Dilla-esque soundscapes over which Baliva delivers messages of self-worth, perseverance, and faith while giving a look into his innermost emotions.</p><p>It's telling, honest and quite refreshing.</p><p>Over songs like <i>Nothing To Prove</i>,  <i>Addicted To Approval</i> and <i>Million Dollar Vanity</i>, he tackles issues that range from social and racial injustice to the overall over-emphasis and reliance that many of us have on not only social media but 'things' in general.</p><p>He's most telling though on songs like the touching <i>Broken Home</i>, where he discusses how painful it is not to be involved in his child's life.

<i>"My purpose is to empower people to live lives filled with hope, courage and freedom"</i>

<i>— Baliva</i>

<i>Imperfect</i> is an audio manifesto, in which Baliva is showing the world who he was, and who he's become.</p><p>He says best on the album's outro, <i>I'm Free</i>: "this project marks a new chapter in my life." He's free from the constant people pleasing, and acceptance seeking that – frankly – plagues a lot of us.</p><p>He's not forcing you to subscribe to what he's saying, rather describing a path towards a respective light he's found in his life.</p><p>Whether you follow him or not, he's saved

Gives this brother a listen.
