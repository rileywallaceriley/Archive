  <div class="content"><p>Newly signed New York Jet Le’Veon Bell — less than a month following an exclusive launch party for his debut album Life’s a Gamble in Miami — took to Twitter on Sunday (March 31) to tease a video for his song “Free At Last.”Asking fans whether they were ready and whether it was flame emoji or waste bin emoji, L.A. Chargers wide receiver Keenan Allen decided to speak his truth.“I gotta keep it band bro This ain’t it,” Allen Tweeted, adding a waste bin emoji.Bell seemed taken aback, responding “If youu honestly felt that way, youu could’ve just txted me and said that…lol but it seems even ppl with check marks wanna troll to seek attention for mentions now a days.” Allen insisted that this was far from a trolling — and proceeded to double down. “I don’t troll.</p><p>Like I said I speak facts.</p><p>You shouldn’t have asked if you ain’t want the truth,” he wrote.As an added insult, Allen added: “It should’ve been your real friends that said it tho.”Check out the whole Twitter exchange, below.</p></div>
