    <div class="content"><p>The rise and fall of one of Hip Hop's more polarizing figures of the past decade, Tekashi 6ix9ine, will be explored in detail in a brand new documentary podcast by Complex in partnership with Spotify.The eight-part Infamous: The Tekashi 6ix9ine Story will take listeners through the unbelievable journey of 23-year-old Tekashi (born Daniel Hernandez). From humble beginnings as a High School dropout working in a Brooklyn Deli to rainbow-haired superstar -- and finally to perhaps the most unabashedly cooperative public federal witness in history."[Tekashi's] story has taken us on a roller coaster ride like nothing we've ever seen in Hip Hop," Infamous narrator Angie Martinez noted in a press release. "So, when Complex reached out with this project, I was excited about the opportunity to help tell this story."Shawn Setaro, senior Complex writer -- and a writer and reporter for the podcast -- notes that no matter what you think you know about Hernandez, the iceberg goes deeper."We interviewed dozens of people, attended many court hearings, and read reams of documents so that we could tell the fascinating, and the sometimes disturbing, story of 6ix9ine in the most authentic way," Setaro tells HipHopDX."Whether you've been following every legal twist and turn or know him from SNL skits, you're going to learn a ton and be totally captivated."https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q4BB7HZ_TYOn Wednesday (December 18) Tekashi is set to learn whether his role as the prosecution's star witness in a case against Nine Trey gang members Anthony "Harv" Ellison and Aljermiah "Nuke" Mack (a role which helped convict Ellison and Mack of multiple felonies) will pay off in the form of "time served."Though he pleaded guilty to several crimes that carry a minimum of 47 years in prison, it's speculated that his cooperation will see him walk away a free man as early as January 2020.Weekly episodes of Infamous: The Tekashi 6ix9ine Story will begin airing January 28 on Spotify.</p></div>
