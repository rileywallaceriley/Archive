  <h1>Juice WRLD Leads "Fuck 6ix9ine" Chant During London Performance</h1>
  <div class="meta">2018-06-28 â€” news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>With his first official singles " All Girls Are the Same" and "Lucid Dreams" enjoying Billboard success (as well as his album Goodbye & Good Riddance peaking at #6 on the Billboard 200), rookie rapper Juice WRLD is having a great 2018.</p><p>It appears that he's now taking aim at another 2018 Billboard mainstay, Tekashi 6ix9ine.During a June 27 stop at London's Oslo Hackney, Juice WRLD led the crowd in a rowdy chant of "fuck 6ix9ine," taking the opportunity to shoot a quick video before repeating "fuck nigga."There isn't any public history of friction between the Tekashi -- who was recently denied entry into the United Kingdom amid legal drama -- and the up-and-coming Chicago rapper.</p><p>It's possible that his dislike stems from the "Gummo" rappers trolling of his hometown and the ongoing feud with Chi-Town staple Chief Keef. 6ix9ine has yet to respond.As far as Juice Wrld's forthcoming non-beef endeavors, his Apple Music Up Next documentary premieres on July 3rd.</p></div>
