    <h1>20 Rap Songs Just As Filthy As Cardi B & Megan Thee Stallion's 'WAP'</h1>
    <div class="meta">2020-08-21 — news</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Amid all the controversy, Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's racy single "WAP" has debuted atop Billboard's Hot 100. However, the endless think pieces and criticism since its release suggest the track is the most explicit sex-themed Hip Hop song ever to garner mainstream success -- which is patently false.So, HipHopDX has amassed a list of 20 NSFW songs that are just as dirty as "WAP" -- in some cases infinitely more so.</p>
<p>Headphones are strongly suggested.Khia - "My Neck, My Back (Lick It)" (2002)XXX Lyrics: "Make sure I keep bustin' nuts nigga/All over yo' face and stuff/Slow head show me so much love/The best head comes from a thug."Khia has always maintained her entire catalog was vastly superior to her undeniable smash hit "My Neck, My Back (Lick It)." But her ultra raunchy salute to an old fashioned downtown meal with back door dessert remains her biggest single. The track peaked at No. 42 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Hot Rap Songs chart.The song also inadvertently birthed the career of another rapper, Saweetie.</p>
<p>Her cover of the song, "Icy Grl," went viral and ultimately led her to a deal with Warner Music Group.Lil Kim f. 50 Cent - "Magic Stick" (2003)XXX Lyrics: "Lil' Kim not a whore/But I sex a nigga so good, he gotta tell his boys/When it, come to sex don't test my skills/Cause my head game have you head over heels."When an artist starts their verse off by noting they aren't a whore, you know you're likely about to get some straight-up filth. This ode to 50 Cent and Kim's respective sex skills was supposed to appear on Fif's debut LP Get Rich or Die Tryin' and feature Trina (so it was destined to be a dirty track no matter what).Certified platinum, the song stands as the second highest-charting for Kim (second only to "Lady Marmalade") peaking at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.Akinyele f.</p>
<p>Kia Jefferies - "Put It In Your Mouth" (1996)XXX Lyrics: "Fuck chapstick/I'm comin ashy as hell, wit chapped dick/for your chapped ass lips."Simply put, this song is iconic. Following a rather underwhelming commercial show out for his debut LP Vagina Diner, Akinyele's timeless anthem for oral sex earned him a cult following, propelling his aptly titled EP of the same name to moderate chart success.The album itself peaked at No. 127 on the Billboard 200 and No. 18 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Album chart.Trina f.</p>
<p>Killer Mike - "Look Back At Me" (2008)XXX Lyrics: "Licky licky licky licky licky for an hour/I'ma make it rain for you here's a golden shower/Smell it like a flower my pussy is a rose/Come a little closer I wanna fuck your nose."In 2008, Trina flexed an enduring ability to make hits with her Still da Baddest LP. The album peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 200 and topped both the Rap Album and R&B/Hip-Hop Album charts.</p>
<p>Though this song (the project's third single) is next-level, even by her standards.An hour-long oral pleasure session, followed by a golden shower and sex with a nose? As far as Billboard songs go (this was No. 71 on the R&B/Hip Hop chart), this one is special.cupcakKe - "Deepthroat" (2016)XXX Lyrics: "Finna get the dick wet and firm (Firm)/You better sweat me out of my perm (My perm)/Can't wait 'til it's my turn/I wanna blow bubbles with sperm."If you're wondering just how dirty the Chicago-native's bars are, well, in 2019, she announced what became a brief retirement citing remorse for corrupting youth.</p>
<p>In this generation (and any generation, really), her music is in a NSFW league of its own. This particular viral song, which appeared on her debut mixtape Cum Cake, is possibly one of the most persuasive examples in her catalog.It makes "WAP" seem tame.</p>
<p>Also, watching reaction videos to her official video for the song is an experience in itself.Choice - "Cat Got Your Tongue" (1990)XXX Lyrics: "Cat got your tongue/And I'm about to cum/Eatin' my pussy like a goddamn honey bun."A list like this wouldn't be complete without acknowledging Houston rapper Choice who burst onto the scene in the late '80s via J. Prince's Rap-A-Lot Records.</p>
<p>With an explicit rap style that pre-dated many of the game's more highly criticized and sexually liberated queens, this song has aged quite well.An ode to being pleasured to the point of literal dehydration, it appeared on her debut The Big Payback, which peaked at No. 46 on the Billboard US R&B chart (which is now known as the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart).Lady - "Yankin" (2010)XXX Lyrics: "This nigga said it feel like that his rubber ain't on/He said 'good pussy' and the feelin be strong."The first lady of Plies' Big Gates Records, Lady saw particular viral fame after a handful of singles found their way onto major network shows such as Skins and Lena Dunham's award-winning HBO series Girls. This song from her sophomore mixtape Bitch From Around The Way 2 appeared in season one episode 10 of the latter.The track is such an earworm that during an interview, executive producer of Girls Jenni Konner recalled walking around the set and hearing everyone singing "this pussy be yankin'" without even realizing it was stuck in their heads.Megan Thee Stallion - "Big Ole Freak" (2018)XXX Lyrics: "I'll fuck him up in the head/Suck it then look in his eyes/Then the next day I might leave 'em on read."Reading an abundance of thought pieces about "WAP" almost makes it seem as though nobody has ever actually listened to Megan's discography.</p>
<p>The saucy spitter first found Billboard success with this freaky-deaky platinum-selling single, which peaked at No. 65 on the Hot 100.In essence, it was her breakthrough, appearing on her sophomore EP Tina Snow, which subsequently peaked at No. 165 on the Billboard Hot 200.Lil Kim f. Sisqo - "How Many Licks" (2000)XXX Lyrics: "This verse goes out to my niggas in jail/Beatin' they dicks to the XXL magazine (uhh)/You like how I look in the aqua green?</p>
<p>Get your Vaseline."From noting she's willing to get down and dirty with a United Nations of men to the mind-bending assertion she can make a Sprite can disappear in her mouth, this song exemplifies why the Queen Bee needs two songs on this list. Not to mention, the video portrayed her as an edible, federal prison approved sex doll.</p>
<p>Wow.The song peaked at No. 75 on the Billboard Hot 100.Ludacris f. Trina, Shawnna & Foxy Brown - "What Your Fantasy (Remix)" (2000)XXX Lyrics: "Ass in his face, cock spread out/Nigga uptown, nigga down south/Same ol' shit, bust in his mouth."Though it originally appeared on his independently released mixtape Incognegro, this song became his breakthrough, becoming a crown jewel of his Def Jam South, triple-platinum debut Back For The First Time.</p>
<p>Though the original was quite sexually charged, this remix was downright nasty, with Luda taking a backseat to the three ladies.They all go for the gusto, but Foxy Brown, who says she specializes in face sitting and putting burners to chests of fellas who can't perform adequately, takes the metaphorical crown.Trick Daddy f. Trina - "Nann" (1999)XXX Lyrics: "Nigga you don't know nann ho uh-uh/That don' tried all types of shit/Who quick to deep throat the dick/And let another bitch straight lick the clit."This song, the lead single off of Trick Daddy's sophomore LP www.thug.com (a real website, FYI), was the official debut of Trina.</p>
<p>In her verse, she boasts casual bisexuality, having sex with her best friends and many more increasingly nasty talking points.Besides making the MC an overnight star, it saw considerable chart success, peaking at No. 62 on the Hot 100.Ying Yang Twins - "Wait (The Whisper Song)" (2005)XXX Lyrics: "You heard what I said, we need to make our way to the bed/You can start using your head/You like to fuck, have ya legs open all in the buck/Toot it up, slappin' ass, gurl the sex get rough."In the pantheon of rap music, few songs fit the bill of "creepy guy anthem" like this smash-hit, which reached No. 15 on the Billboard 100. "Hey bitch, wait till you see my dick," has to be the least romantic bar of all time. But while it's a little cringe in hindsight, it was undeniable when it dropped, helping propel U.S.A. (United State of Atlanta) to 3x-platinum success.The album itself also debuted at No. 2 on the Hot 200, which stands as the duo's highest-charting release.Ghostface Killah - "Stapleton Sex" (2009)XXX Lyrics: "You can put my, dick in your mouth and play with my nuts/But before I bust, babe, I think I'll cum in your butt."Ghostdini: Wizard of Poetry in Emerald City may not be the most highly revered project in Ghost's discography, but it was fifth highest-charting, coming in at No. 28 on the Hot 200.</p>
<p>This particular gem from the album is more or less an incredibly graphic erotic short story.He has his share of sexually charged bars throughout his catalog, but this one takes the cake.Lil Wayne - "Pussy Monster" (2008)XXX Lyrics: "When I swallow ma spit, I could still taste you/Put that pussy in ma face every time I face you/It goes P-U-S-S-Y/Because it's the reason I am alive."A lawsuit forced Wayne to remove the Rolling Stones-inspired "Playing With Fire" from the tracklist of subsequent versions of his arguable opus The Carter III. He replaced it with this under-appreciated (and under-criticized) ode to something he never really hides anyway: his love of pleasing women.</p>
<p>How well it's aged is up for debate.The imagery of a bowl of stew depleted of its contents and left with juices that he drinks with a spoon is ... unforgettable, for lack of a better term.David Banner - "Play" (2005)XXX Lyrics: "Finger fuck your pussy like you want some, girl/Work it like a nigga straight licking on your pearl."David Banner hit a mainstream apex with this super dirty gold-selling single, which remains his sole Top 10 hit, peaking at No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100. In some ways, this song was a missed opportunity to do some incredible remixes.</p>
<p>There was one that fit the bill featuring Ying Yang Twins, which makes sense as it could easily have been a song by the duo if Banner had passed on the beat. The other one, though, was a Canadian version featuring Kardinal Offishall and Solitair, which was odd.Too $hort - "Cocktales"XXX Lyrics: "She was fine as fuck, but can't fuck with Tina/Tina, Tina, the sperm cleana'/I took her to my house and I told her "strip"/Baby got freaky started doing the splits."Sure, "Blow the Whistle" became $hort Dawg's signature single, but it was far from his best performing on Billboard upon its release and leagues away from his dirtiest entry on the charts.</p>
<p>This single off of his ninth studio album Cocktails goes through his (fictitious) super-pimp Rolodex, describing a laundry list of sexual conquests in immense detail.While the song peaked at No. 3 on the Rap chart, it more impressively reached, wait for it, No. 69 on the Hot 100. Nice.Snoop Doggy Dogg f.</p>
<p>Nate Dogg & Warren G - "Ain't No Fun (If The Homies Can't Have None)"XXX Lyrics: "Next time I'm feeling kinda horny/You can come on over/And I'll break you off/And if you can't fuck that day baby/Just lay back and open your mouth."There were many timeless moments on Uncle Snoop's iconic 4x-platinum debut LP Doggystyle, but Nate Dogg's first verse on "Ain't No Fun" remains one of the brightest. It's hard to imagine this song even being allowed to exist in today's climate, more or less painting females as money pits made for pleasure.</p>
<p>Still, it remains fondly revered among fans.This album wasn't without controversy at the time, though, drawing immense scrutiny from groups laser-focused on silencing "gangsta rap."Nicki Minaj f. Drake, Lil Wayne & Chris Brown - "Only"XXX Lyrics: "Yo, I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake/On my life, man, fuck's sake/If I did, I'd ménage with 'em and let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake."There have been many songs before "Only" that attempted to pit male group or collective members in competition for a female lead.</p>
<p>Hell, Black Eyed Peas did it with Fergie ("Don't Phunk with My Heart"). But this one kicks things up a notch.</p>
<p>From Nicki noting if she were to sleep with Wayne and Drizzy, she'd let them feast on her posterior like cupcakes to Drake spending too much time describing a BBW fetish, there's a lot to unpack here.The song reached No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart, which was Nicki's fourth time doing so.Missy Elliott - "Pussycat"XXX Lyrics: "Are you ready for some cavi from me/Pussy, gushy, mushy, what more you want from me."Missy's discography is chock full of sex-themed bars, but this song stands out in particular. It was initially supposed to be the third single from her double-platinum Under Construction album and meant to be backed with a remix featuring Janet Jackson and Lil Kim.</p>
<p>However, the trio allegedly found a way to make a song about pep-talking a vagina to peak performance too dirty for audiences. The label scrapped the remix, but the world deserves to hear it, in my opinion.Megan Thee Stallion f.</p>
<p>Nicki Minaj & Ty Dolla $ign - "Hot Girl Summer"XXX Lyrics: "Fuckin' 9-to-5 niggas with that superstar D/Fucked a superstar nigga, now I got him ballin'/I caught a jet to get that neck, I told him call, don't send no text."Strangely, many people find "WAP" to be a line in the sand when this song exists. Hot Girl Summer was a super-viral term in 2019, amounting to what most understood as seasonal glow up, though this song more closely described it as a Woodstock level of free-love in the name of dominating the wallets of males who possess "superstar D."The single reached No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100.What are your favorite dirty rap lyrics?</p>
