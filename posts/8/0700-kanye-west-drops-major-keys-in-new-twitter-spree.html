  <div class="content"><p>There are two things that most people have come to accept: Kanye West is an avant-garde thinker, and when he tweets it's with conviction and purpose.</p><p>Now, just days after he revealed he was writing a new philosophy book, Yeezy took to Twitter to give fans a taste of what to expect."When you first wake up don't hop right on the phone or the internet or even speak to anyone for even up to an hour if possible," he began his latest rant with. "Just be still and enjoy your own imagination.</p><p>It's better than any movie."He followed up with a bevy of inspirational quotes that focused on believing in -- and following your own instincts. "Follow your own vision. base your actions on love ... do things you love and if you don't love something stop doing it as soon as you can.""Don't follow crowds.</p><p>Follow the innate feelings inside of you," he continued. "Do what you feel not what you think."He also added some more insight into his upcoming book, Breaking the Simulation, while carefully noting that there is no clear timeline for when we can expect it. "I will work on this "book" when I feel it," he wrote.He also curiously noted that "this is my book that I'm writing in real time.</p><p>No publisher or publicist will tell me what to put where or how many pages to write."This isn't Kanye's first foray into the world of published thought.</p><p>Following his highly successful Glow In The Dark Tour back in 2008, Ye teamed up with author J. Sakiya Sandifer to create Thank You And You're Welcome, which largely showcased humorous anecdotes.</p><p>Now that he's a bit older, it appears Kanye is honing in on positivity and inspiration — above all.</p><p>You can check out all the recent Kanye tweets, below.</p></div>
