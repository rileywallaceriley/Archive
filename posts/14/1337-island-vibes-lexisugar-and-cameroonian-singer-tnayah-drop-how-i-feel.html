— Lexisugar</blockquote>

Nigerian-born LexiSugar has made quite a name for himself, establishing a presence creating sounds for artists, movies and TV shows--and, running the gambit: from recording and audio engineering to performing and musical consulting.</p><p>Some of his clients include renowned artists like Falz, Seyi Shay, Tiwa Savage, Atemi, and much more.</p><p>Under his own imprint, he recently released his new single "How I Feel" featuring award-winning Cameroon songstress, Tnayah who has a healthy catalog of noteworthy records, including her debut album,  LVLS which buzzed the Cameroonian radio waves all year long.</p><p>To call this song a potential hit is an understatement.</p><p>With a reggae vibe, a bluesy melody, and the playful combination of Lexi and Tnayah vocals on the chorus, this song feels like a musical manifestation of whispering game in the ear of a sexy lady while grinding the night away under the stars after a few too many rum punches.</p><p>It's a soulful vibe that hits with the same type of impact as Sean Paul's "<a href=" Still In Love With You</a>."

"How I Feel" is a soulful expression of love, explains Lexi to AAHH.</p><p>The track is off of Lexisugar’s debut project set for release this May.</p><p>His love for jazz, r&amp;b, and soul music is a reflection in all of his work--in fact, a trip through his discography is highly recommended.</p><p>It's a hearty blend of contemporary adult contemporary, jazz, and straight up world music that you'll probably get obsessed with; I'd recommend "<a href="https://soundcloud.com/lexisugar/storyteller">Story Teller</a>," "<a href="https://soundcloud.com/lexisugar/hameed-lexisugar-tnayah-reach-the-stars">Reach The Stars</a>," and "<a href="https://soundcloud.com/lexisugar/orejesu">Ore Jesu</a>," all available on his Soundcloud (all with varying capacities).</p><p>I digress, though. "How I Feel" is the record of the moment and more than worth a spot on whatever playlist you have in place this week.</p><p>DJs, take note.
