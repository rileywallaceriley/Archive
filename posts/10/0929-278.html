Not that we want to get too deep into it, but she spoke nothing but truth about Iggy Azalea – she's not really hip-hop, period.</p><p>It's disrespectful for anyone to try to discredit or disregard the rightful opinion of an industry veteran.</p><p>We're the only culture that disposes of our artists so quickly, especially ones who were part of notable or influential movements!</p><p>Preservation of the culture we live starts with us – <em>believe</em> that!</p><p>Anyways, the track is slamming.</p><p>We're not sure when a more complete product will come our way from Rah, but these snacks will definitely tide us over.</p></div>
