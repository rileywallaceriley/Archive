  <h1>The Rock Celebrates “Hobbs & Shaw” Success While Dumping On Tyrese</h1>
  <div class="meta">2019-08-13 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>The first official spin-off from the Fast & Furious universe, Hobbs & Shaw, opened in theatres August 2 — and has since topped the box office grossing just over $330 million worldwide.</p><p>Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson (who stars alongside Jason Statham in the film) took to social media to celebrate its success, while subtly slanging some mud at its largest detractor, Tyrese Gibson.“Thank you everyone for makin’ this an exciting first week of box office for our lil’ spin-off,” he wrote. “And remember, the best way to shut the mouth of a  is to flex with success and a smile.”Tyrese had long voiced his displeasure with Johnson over the project, citing delayed production (and paydays) for the ninth installment of the Furious franchise.“Breaking up the family clearly doesn’t have the value that one would assume it does. #FastFamily has more value as the #FastFamily,” the singer wrote in an extended response.“$180 million dollar global opening on Hobbs & Shaw is NOT a win ... my respects cause he tried his best.”https://youtu.be/xosQE3vNkdkHobbs & Shaw saw $60 million domestic box office during its opening weekend, which didn't fare quite as strong as Fate of the Furious (the eighth film in the franchise), which cracked $100 million.Fate of the Furious also became the third-fastest film in history to gross $500 million worldwide, passing the milestone in just five days.Despite the seemingly one-sided hard feelings, it appears that Fast & Furious 9 is in the works — with Tyrese posting what seems to be facial scanning for the film to his Instagram on Tuesday (August 13).The movie is slated for release in spring of 2020.</p></div>
