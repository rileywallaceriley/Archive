  <h1>Here's 1st Look At Live-Action ”Aladdin” Film Starring Will Smith</h1>
  <div class="meta">2018-10-12 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Disney gave fans a first-look at the live-action version of the 1992 animated film Aladdin on Thursday (October 11).</p><p>The film stars Will Smith as the genie, who was originally voiced by the late Robin Williams.Though we (understandably) don’t get to see Smith in the trailer, we do see director Guy Ritchie’s take on the cave of wonders, where Aladdin — the diamond in the rough — finds the magic lamp. addressing whether Smith’s role in the film would at all mimic that of Robin William during CinemaCon, Disney executive Cathleen Taff described Smith’s performance as “a little Fresh Prince, a little Hitch and a whole lot of attitude.”Smith unveiled the film’s official poster on Instagram, adding “ can’t wait for y’all to see me blue.”Aladdin opens in theatres May 24, 2019.</p></div>
