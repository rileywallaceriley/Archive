  <h1>Action Bronson – Mr. Wonderful</h1>

  <div class="content"><p><blockquote>He still has bars on top of bars – stuffed with more bars; however this album seems far less rushed.</blockquote>
As far as rap characters go, there aren't many in the game with the background of overweight-spitter Action Bronson, coming straight out of Flushing Queens.</p><p>Aside from his infamous <i>Fuck That's Delicious</i> web series, he's been hitting you with heaters for the past few years now.</p><p>Amidst early comparisons to Wu-Tang Clan over-achiever Ghostface Killah – whom he toured with (haters) – Action has risen into the spotlight and it's now his time to smack the rap game in the f—ing face on a commercial level.</p><p>Listening to this project it's hard to swallow (<i>pause</i>) that he's been rapping for just over five years.</p><p>He quit his career as a chef to pursue rap, which will explain his extremely elaborate food references.</p><p>After a fifth full listen I've come to some conclusions about Action's major-label debut album, <i>Mr.</p><p>Wonderful</i>.</p><p>It's brilliant.</p><p>If you've been following his career over the past few years, you'll notice the growth he's had.</p><p>He still has bars on top of bars – stuffed with more bars; however this album seems far less rushed.</p><p>It has an interesting blend of sounds and emotions.</p><p>The fun, airy vibe of the Mark Ronson produced <i>Brand New Car</i> sets the tone nicely.</p><p>Don't go into this album without a sense of humour and an open mind.</p><p>The soundscape here is so well compiled.</p><p>From the absolutely gorgeous <i>Terry</i> produced by Alchemist, the radio-friendly <i>Actin' Crazy</i> produced by OVO's own 40 to the psychedelic Party Supplies produced <i>Easy Rider</i>, he literally bodies every beat – one exception (for me) was the Oh No produced <i>Only In America</i>.</p><p>It was a little more "meh" than the rest of the tracks.</p><p>The album's most memorable moments happen halfway through when Action sings on the funky Mark Ronson joint <i>City Boy Blues</i>, which transitions in the <b>super dope</b> <i>Baby Blue Eyes</i>, featuring Chance The Rapper.</p><p>If you haven't peeped the visuals for that track yet, scroll to the bottom.</p><p>You're welcome.</p><p>Overall it's an incredibly impressive album.</p><p>It has bars, amazing production and enough reply value to keep this one in the deck for a hot minute.</p><p>I recently read that he's also releasing a cook book with a number of famous chefs.</p><p>Like it or not, Action is shaping up to have a better year than most of the other rappers on the scene right now.</p><p>Don't hate – make better music.
