  <h1>Art & Hip-Hop: Check Out Ace Lover</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sat, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Came across a cool artist that I  slept on back in the day.</p><p>He goes by the name Ace Lover, and he's been bubbling on the New York City  scene for a minute.</p><p>The self-described "hispanglish homeboy" got his start as when he was 17 -- the MC, battle rapper, and street artist released two 12" records that made some noise.</p><p>I should also not downplay that he is a <i>serious</i> battle head; in fact, If I'm not mistaken he was heavy on the Braggin' Rites scene.</p><p>He even battled the late PH in his heyday (check out this <a href="https://youtu.be/_GMtGu5Yobo">Vast Aire record they both appeared on</a>).</p><p>After leaving his  imprint and signing with the Fat Beat distributed Cajo Communications, he released some records with rapper Oktober under the collective guise, <a href="https://youtu.be/KHOjNkwhKWI">2for5</a>.</p><p>During this time (the early 00's), he toured US and Canada and was even named one of the next 100 upcoming artists to look out for by URB magazine.</p><p>His last release, which was 2015's self-titled Ace Lover, he dropped a stack of what he calls "visual music art" videos.</p><p>His love of the arts, though, has seemed to bubble to the forefront this year, as this year is his contemporary art coming out -- so to speak -- after years of paying dues on the street art scene.</p><p>On top of his  exhibition, he launched a pop-up shop where you can cop some of his pieces."

He has a unique catalogue, and -- if you're not familiar with him --he's worth checking out, especially if you're a lover of straight up bred-in-NYC indie hip-hop!</p><p>Start with his super dope record "Amazing Brains," and binge on from there.</p><p>You're welcome.</p></div>
