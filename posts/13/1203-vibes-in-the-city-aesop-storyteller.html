  <h1>Vibes In The City: Aesop Storyteller</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Aesop Storyteller seems to be a part of the growing conscious rap era.</p><p>He’s very aware of his community and the story that needs to be told.</p><p>His album Melanin is available for streaming and purchase on ITunes.</p><p>Aesop Storyteller was a featured act for last week’s Vibes In the City. 

<b>AAHH: Cool name, how’d you come up with it? </b>

AS: I got the name ASAP  from when I used to hustle in the streets in the late 90’s and early 2000’s.</p><p>I had to change the spelling, so there’s no confusion with any other rappers.</p><p>Storyteller came from my propensity to reenact or put a comedic twist on things that happened in the hood.</p><p>Once I started making music professionally, I combined the two elements of my brand in the streets to create a modern-day version of the Great African storyteller and the creator of Aesop’s Fabbles who goes by the same name and spelling. 
 
<b>AAHH: Your Album <i>Melanin</i> is now available on ITunes and available for streaming on Apple Music.</p><p>What was it like making an album like that?</p><p>And what's your favorite song off there?</b>

<b>AS</b>: Creating an album called <i>Melanin</i> took a whole lot of reading and watching boring YouTube documentaries about Africans worldwide.</p><p>I came up with the concept while in Jamaica speaking to some Rastas about how best to honor our skin pigment and soulful expression.</p><p>It is critically important that this album is in the marketplace at a time where collectively people are awakening to the fact that natural melanin characteristics and features are a sacred gift from God.</p><p>My favorite song on this particular album is “Single and Ready To Mingle” because of the instant positive energy it spread.</p><p>It’s a fun record to dance and be silly to. 

<b>AAHH: Five years from now, where do you see yourself as an artist? </b>

<b>AS</b>: Five years from now I see myself touring the world, spreading my message of knowledge, self, and the growth of mind, body, and soul.</p><p>But more importantly, I would love to continue to develop young people so that they can accomplish more than I ever did. 

<b>AAHH: Any social media? </b>

<b>AS</b>: I’m on all major social media sites.</p><p>Twitter: @Aesoplyrics, Instagram: @AesopStoryteller, Facebook: loosebandz, YouTube: aesopthestoryteller, Bandcamp: Aesopstoryteller, Soundcloud: Aesoplyrics.
