  <h1>Jeymes Samuel’s ‘The Book of Clarence’ OST Is An Eclectic Ride Worthy Of Multiple Spins</h1>
  <div class="meta">2024-01-19 — reviews</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Two years after his directorial feature-length film debut, The Harder They Fall, multifaceted creative Jeymes Samuel returns with a new movie, The Book of Clarence, produced by, among others (including Samuel himself), JAY-Z.Soundtracks of recent day often subscribe to the 'less is more' adage, overstuffing tracklists with forgettable fodder (think Space Jam 2).</p><p>Jeymes, however, took a different approach with his latest flick, crafting the soundtrack himself, billing it as "a Jeymes Samuel album" with a carefully curated guest list.Nailing the curation to perfection, he finds captivating hooks for multiple swaths of listeners.</p><p>The album's arguably highest apex, the rewind-worthy "Hallelujah Heaven" featuring Lil Wayne, Buju Banton, and the always noteworthy Shabba Ranks, is a collaboration built to cause niche excitement for a certain generational pocket.Likewise, "JEEZU" featuring Def Jam-affiliated afrobeats star Adekunle Gold, Kodak Black and Doja Cat — who continues to prove she can stand toe-to-toe with the top MCs of the day — appeals to an entirely different audience.</p><p>Her energy is palpable, as she spits: "When you got integrity, there's no room for apologies/ Now they actin' kind to me 'cause I ain't in economy/ Cats dogmatic 'til they see I got the dog in me."The diversity of the soundtrack is its greatest strength.</p><p>Jeymes doesn’t just play to the strengths of his guests, he brings them into his world of eclectic, focused funk and soul vibes.</p><p>His duet with famed Brazilian singer Jorge Ben Jor and his collaboration with Yemi Alade take listeners on a top-to-bottom musical excursion, fusing genres in the best way possible.One quasi letdown is the D'Angelo and JAY-Z featured "I Want You Forever"; though an obvious bucket list notch in Samuel’s belt, it doesn’t live up to the "soulful biblical bliss" grandeur he promised previously.</p><p>Sonically snug in the playlist, D'Angelo sounds great, yet he is boxed into repetition.</p><p>With nine minutes at their disposal, there could have been a lot more variation.JAY-Z, on the other hand, delivers a verse so laid-back and lacking in energy, that it's easy to imagine he dropped it halfway through a bottle of bourbon from an armchair.</p><p>The song is reminiscent in its approach to OutKast's "SpottieOttieDopaliscious," though it features Hov rhyming rather than speaking, which makes him sound slightly off-kilter at points.</p><p>However, when he starts overemphasizing in the latter half of his verse, he begins to hit his stride.Jeymes himself offers a few of the project’s most intriguing moments all on his own. "Dear Heaven" and "Nazarene" exude an inescapable new-age Curtis Mayfield vibe, with his distinct, soulful voice — not to mention his pen game — sparkling like a VVS diamond.Other big names join the set, like Kid Cudi, who provides a dazzling performance on "Godqueen," and Jorja Smith, whose silky vocals on "Champagne" feel like chicken soup for the soul.</p><p>With Jeymes and JAY-Z both working in a production capacity for Cudi’s upcoming Netflix film Teddy, it’s intriguing to imagine if "Godqueen" might be a precursor to that movie's soundtrack.Ultimately, The Book Of Clarence stands as an incredibly solid soundtrack, worthy of multiple spins.</p><p>If you’re someone who gets lost in the sea of sameness, it's a brilliant introduction to some new sounds and artists worth digging into further.RELEASE DATE: January 12, 2024RECORD LABEL: Geneva Club/Roc NationListen to The Book of Clarence Soundtrack below:https://open.spotify.com/album/5LTfMQMnfrNd2Zj1HLZUmN?si=RBISXDHoTae5Ira8F9vGkA</p></div>
