  <h1>M-See Serves Up Some Soul Food</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Can music truly be intelligent, positive and banging all at once?</p><p>Well, a spin through your local radio dial shouts loudly, “NO.” If you’ve been following the most recent shift in the industry, though, you’ve probably noticed a new breed of golden era sensibility creeping back into the mainstream pipeline, leading to a new crop of artists who have bars – and an excellent chance of actually gaining recognition.</p><p>There’s also been a shift from the singles-era into a new day where artists seem to once again care about creating cohesive, solid, complete projects, rather than disjointed compilations and sloppy mixtapes.</p><p>It’s a great day for music fans.</p><p>One of the latest artists I’ve recently discovered in this vein is Malcom Crittenden, aka M-See, who hails from Historic Selma, Al.</p><p>At a tender age he developed a passion for music and rhyming – and some years later he's dropped his third project, <em>Soul Food: Music For The Soul</em>.</p><p>With a solid foundation of mainstream radio spins and buzz under his belt, this new project delivers a healthy dose of faith, reliability, sensibility and genuine love for hip-hop.</p><p>From the album's title track, we’re instantly introduced to the fact that he’s using soul food as a metaphor for realness, down-home/ homegrown music – as a stark contrast for the more manufactured "fast-food", to which we’ve become accustomed.</p><p>M-See comes off with an almost melodic flow.</p><p>I’ll try my best to sum up his sound, but it’s a bizarre blend of Andre 3000, Drake, A slowed down Twista and a young T.I. There are moments that don’t particularly stand out on this album; however, on songs like More Than Money, he sets himself apart with straight up bars like:

<strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">“I think it’s come time, to show you that I'm bright like the sunshine; take over the world, and when I’m done, Imma have a son and show you how my son shine.”</span> </em>
</strong>
M-See does shine when he steps away from the mainstream influence and gets real.</p><p>Songs like <em>One Time</em>, <em>No Justice No Freedom</em>, <em>Prayer For Sel</em> and <em>Morning</em> show off his pen game, and gives listeners a deeper look at what he has to offer the game.</p><p>Standouts on this album are the bassy <em>Don’t Lie to Me</em>, and the super dope <em>Paper Cutz</em> (which is a <strong>must listen</strong>).</p><p>Sitting at 19 joints, the album is a pretty heavy plate of soul food to get through – and maybe could have been two smaller portions.</p><p>Regardless, it is a solid, and cohesive listen.</p><p>You can tell that M-See took his time in the kitchen – as you can hear the quality.</p><p>Once you make your way through <em>Soul Food: Music For The Soul</em>, you’ll want to check out his other LP, <em><a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/msee?SourceCode=widgetbaby">Malcolm X, A Soulful Experience</a></em>.</p><p>This is that type of food that sticks to your body – grab a plate!
