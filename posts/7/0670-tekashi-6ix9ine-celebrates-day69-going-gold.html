  <div class="meta">2018-05-23 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Criticism and controversy aside, Hip Hop’s troll extraordinaire Tekashi 6ix9ine can’t seem to stop winning.</p><p>The polarizing artist celebrated his DAY69 mixtape being certified gold by the RIAA in an Instagram video on Wednesday (May 23)."IT took OTHER niggas 2 years with 2 mixtapes and a WHOLE album on the way Features with Drake, Travis Scott, Swaelee, XXX tentacion, Diplo etc," he wrote as the caption to the post. "LMAOOOOOOOO I DID IT WITH NOTHING this shows every kid out there YOU DONT NEED TO SUCK NO INDUSTRY DICK TO BE POPPIN."This is the third certification for the 22-year-old artist, who scored a gold plaque for “Kooda” and a platinum plaque for his breakout hit “Gummo.” The DAY69 mixtape has spawned six singles that landed on Billboard’s Hot 100 — three of which landed in the Top 10 of the Hip Hop Songs chart.Despite his musical success, 6ix9ine continues to be in the headlines for the wrong reasons.</p><p>This week, he allegedly assaulted a police officer and was accused of stealing a beat from a K-Pop group.</p></div>
