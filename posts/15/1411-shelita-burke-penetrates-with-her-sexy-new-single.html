  <h1>Shelita Burke 'Penetrates' With Her Sexy New Single</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sat, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Sort of quirky — and super unique — singer Shelita Burke is a singer I wrote about last year when she released her EP <i>Transfixed</i> and lead single "Belong," which was produced by industry vet Bellringer.</p><p>If you missed my previous piece (<a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/shelita-burke-gives-brain-orgasms-with-her-new-single/">shame on you</a>), I'll give you a quick Cliff's Notes on why you need to check Shelita Out.</p><p>For starters, some of the most trusted names in music, like NPR, have mentioned her as an artist to watch, and — upon her initial release — was of MTV's top 10 artists overall (on their artist platform), which is bonkers.</p><p>She's toured around the world and lives in both Paris and LA, which gives her a super broad perspective on things and, lest we forget, <i>Transfixed</i> reached #14 on Amazon's Music Charts.</p><p>She has a really strong social media presence, and a supportive core audience that wants to see her win; her schtick is connecting.</p><p>Lastly, she stood out to me because of her obsession with Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR).</p><p>She explained it last year as “a pleasurable tingling ‘brain tickle’ effect.</p><p>Yeah, she gives brain orgasms.</p><p>So, that's an auto spin in my books.</p><p>Shelita recently released a new track called "Penetrate (Part 2)," a follow-up to the Bellringer produced "Penetrate" that hit #14 on Billboard’s ‘Next Big Sound’ chart.</p><p>The song has an almost early 2000's Neptune's vibe to it and a less than subtle sexiness that lends itself perfectly to beers on warm summer evening, or a solo late-night drive through a sleepy metropolitan city centre.</p><p>Her super unique cadence sparkles, and her songwriting shine.</p><p>The song's press releases teased an upcoming video for the song, which I'm excited to see.</p><p>Shelita doesn't just have fans; she has superfans.</p><p>That's for a good reason; it's not something that Incan easily pinpoint, but she has it factor and 'cuteness' (that perfectly counterbalances the sensuality of her songs).</p><p>Check out the new track for yourself!
