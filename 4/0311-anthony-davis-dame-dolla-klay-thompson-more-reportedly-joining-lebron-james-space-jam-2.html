  <h1>Anthony Davis, Dame Dolla, Klay Thompson & More Reportedly Joining LeBron James’ “Space Jam 2”</h1>
  <div class="meta">2019-06-20 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>As the long-prophesied reboot of the 1997 film Space Jam allegedly prepares the start filming during the NBA offseason, we now have a clearer idea of whom LeBron James and the Toon Squad will be hooping against.According to a few new reports, the cast is set to include James’ newly acquired teammate Anthony Davis, Portland Trailblazers star guard Damian Lillard, Golden State Warriors’ shooting guard Klay Thompson, and Houston Rockets' point guard Chris Paul. "White Mamba" (WNBA great Diana Lorena Taurasi) as well as Nneka and Chiney Ogwumike — who both hold the distinction of being the only siblings besides Eli and Peyton Manning to be drafted No. 1 overall in the history of U.S. professional sports — will also appear in the film.The exact plot isn’t clear so it’s difficult to speculate if the players named will make up a reimagined version of the Monstars — a group of evil aliens from Moron Mountain.</p><p>There is a possibility that Davis could take on the short/sweet role played by Bill Murray. https://youtu.be/KIV_9--awCIThe original box-office smash starred Michael Jordan and featured NBA stars Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing and Shawn Bradley.</p><p>It also sported a Hip Hop/R&B-centric soundtrack featuring Method Man, LL Cool J, Busta Rhymes, Salt-N-Pepa, Monica and more.</p></div>
