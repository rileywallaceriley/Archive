  <h1>Big Boi x Phantogram – The Big Grams EP</h1>
  <div class="meta">Sat, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Although the combination of Big Boi and NYC-based electro-rock-pop duo Phantogram seems unlikely on the surface, it's not that hard to swallow .</p><p>I mean, Big Boi, was once partnered with Andre 3000 to form what had (eventually) become the most matched, mid-matched duo in hip-hop history.</p><p>In fact, their final album, Speaker Boxxx/Love Below, was split into two completely separate albums – and the contrast between the two was staggering.</p><p>What I'm getting at is that clearly the man isn't afraid to take chances, musically.</p><p>Well, a pop-up ad, led Big Boi to Shazam the duo of Sarah Barthel and Josh Carter – and here we are!</p><p>After months of teasing, and some epic performances, they officially dropped their self-titled EP.

<i><a href="http://smarturl.it/BigGrams">Big Grams</a> </i>is an absolute joy to listen to.</p><p>What I appreciate the most, and I'm sure many listeners would agree, is that it delivers exactly what you think it will.</p><p>They all live up to their individual strengths and deliver songs that are fun and incredibly dope.</p><p>When an artist is truly enjoying the process and is genuinely inspired, it carries through to the music. <i>Lights On</i> and <i>Fell Into The Sun</i> have been knocking out of my speakers for the past few hours on repeat.</p><p>Also, if you've ever dreamed what Big Boi may sound like over Premo-esque east coast production, you'll want to pump <i>Put It On Her</i> with the windows down in the ride.</p><p>The only misstep for me was that Skrillex joint...meh.</p><p>It's a great listen, and the perfect way to kick-off the autumn music rush.</p><p>If you can tear yourself away from Drake and Future, definitely <a href="http://smarturl.it/BigGrams">drop this into your music </a>device and let it run around a few times.
