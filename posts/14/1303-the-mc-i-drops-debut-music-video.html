  <h1>The MC i Drops Debut Music Video</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>The six is dripping with talent--Tory Lanez and Jazz Cartier are the tip of the the iceberg.</p><p>Case and point, The MC i, who recently popped up on the scene with his record "Kno Dats Me." Dripping in "Bacardi Slang," the single--and high quality  video--give an exciting look at what the artist has to offer.</p><p>With a style sensibility that more leans towards a gentlemanly vibe of someone like Jidenna rather than a more street rapper, his sing-songy flows and distinctive look are intriguing.</p><p>With a night time vibe, and little biographical content out there , he has a mystique that currently exists.</p><p>I can't put my finger on whether he's a street rapper or not--but his lyrical content suggests he's not a cat to take lightly.</p><p>At the end of the day--I know nothing about this kid, but I'm feeling this first impression enough to keep it locked.</p><p>Give the video a look for yourself--and if you feel the same let me know; better yet, mash the share button.</p></div>
