  <h1>Xleoniduz Takes Us On A Trip To Versace Mansion</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, â€” aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Florida rapper Xleoniduz has made many appearances here on the site leading up to his upcoming full-length.</p><p>His latest single, Versace Mansion is unexpectedly deep--we think.</p><p>The record has X dropping a mix of spoken work and bars in a Quasimoto-esque modulated voice; the song describes a dreamlike mansion at great lengths.</p><p>From the sound of waves to painted ceilings and incredible artwork, it sounds like the type of house you'd expect to see in a big-budget music video.</p><p>Except, the song has an oddly unnerving tone to it.</p><p>Is it a dream?</p><p>Is he dead, describing an idealized version of a 'street kid's heaven?' There a few clues, including mention of that fact that he saw Tupac, and that he never wanted to leave.</p><p>Both lending to the fact that it's a dream of some sort.</p><p>Also, it can be argued that the use of a voice that isn't his is a subtle way of detaching.</p><p>All this, though, is us looking into the record without his actual clarification.</p><p>He described it as 'New Age' on his SoundClound--which is fair.</p><p>It's much different than his other records thus far, and was harder to get into, but still a great tune.</p><p>Take a listen.
