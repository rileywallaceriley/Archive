  <div class="content"><p>Detroit Hip Hop vets — and former J. Dilla collaborators — Big Tone and producer House Shoes have released a new visual for their single “From My Mouth To Gods Ears,” off of their new collaborative LP, Big Shoes.“Nothing has the power to bring people together, or separate people like faith, or the test of it,” Tone tells HipHopDX. “The song and video are about living your truth and pursuing wholeness while living amongst confusion, deception, and mystery.“That’s pretty much the underlying theme of the whole album,” he adds.</p><p>The 12-song project is produced entirely by House Shoes and features guest appearances from Quelle Chris, Denmark Vessey, Blu, Jimetta Rose, Ta’Raach, and others.“ is all about fitting the shoes that came before you and filling the shoes that will come after you,” House Shoes adds about the project’s concept. “Taking the best from those who led and teaching those who will follow in your footsteps how to lead.”Watch the video above, and stream Big Shoes, below.https://open.spotify.com/album/6yyl2mIG6XC6XWkP2s5nSA?si=Qd_E99LYTGiJXlBL67n0vw</p></div>
