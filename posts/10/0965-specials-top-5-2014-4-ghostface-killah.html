  <h1>Special’s Top 5 of 2014: #4 Ghostface Killah</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>The Wu-Tang Clan is legendary, no argument there.</p><p>The argument <em>does</em> arise when we’re discussing who are your fave spitters from the (originally) nine-man Staten-Island outfit.</p><p>Method Man, regardless of solo-success <em>always</em> seems to get a pass and Chef is universally accepted as one of its greats – but I think it’s impossible to not praise GFK for his innovation and sheer work ethic.</p><p>He recently blessed us with his 10th solo effort <em>36 Seasons</em>, a gorgeous conceptual album released on Tommy Boy Records.

Conceptual albums are no small feat – and few have really done the format as much justice as Price Paul and Raekwon; although, GFK does a great job weaving a lyrically strong story that follows his return home after a nine year prison sentence.</p><p>He finds it hard to stay away from the game (especially after learning his girl has <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tommy-boy-1/lovedontliveherenomore">moved on with another man</a>) and returns to a life of crime only to be set-up.</p><p>The story, which plays out over 14 songs features a supporting cast of characters played by AZ, Kool G Rap, Tre Williams, Pharoahe Monch, Rell, Kadence Springs, Shawn Wigs and The Revelations.

Standouts for us were <em>Emergency Procedure</em>, which sees Ghostface being saved after the botched heist by a Doctor played by Pharoahe Monch, and <em>Blood In the Streets</em>, which sees Ghostface out for vengeance against the man who double crossed him (played by AZ).</p><p>The one maybe 'con' of this project, if you want to call it that, is that many of the songs seem wildly out of context outside of the album – which should be a better reason to give this a front to back spin.</p><p>It's also an inescapable by-product of this format.</p><p>A playful mix of introspective soul and gritty hiphop, Ghostface’s 36 Seasons is all of the creativity and wordplay that we’ve come to expect from GFK – too bad we didn’t enjoy the <em><a href="http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wu-tang-clan-a-better-tommorow-review/">A Better Tomorrow</a></em> as much as this one!</p><p>It’s available now everywhere you can cop music – a MUST LISTEN.
