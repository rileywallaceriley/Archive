  <h1>The Sound Of Experience: Meet East Koast</h1>
  <div class="meta">Thu, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>The 90's hip-hop sound had a very specific sound/feel to it.</p><p>It's often duplicated, and many artists claim to be "bringing it back"...but it's not that simple.</p><p>The music we grew up on was driven less by money and overt commercial intervention.</p><p>It was motivated by the love of the culture.</p><p>The sound that artists are trying to duplicate is comprised of gritty MPC beats, record pops and above all bars – unadulterated street hip-hop.</p><p>The kind of shit that you heard on warm summer nights on college radio shows across your respective nation.</p><p>Every once in a while I come across an artist that takes me there, and I consider it my constant duty as a "curator of the real" to bring them to your attention.</p><p>Let me introduce you to East Koast – a Harlem rapper with a super interesting background in the industry.</p><p>His roots run deep, like Dallas Austin deep (literally).</p><p>His cousin is Mr.</p><p>Malik from the famed 90s group <a href="http://www.xxlmag.com/news/bloggers/2009/10/flashback-friday-remember-illegal/">Illegal</a>, and he came up as a background figure in the game, helping in the development of some seminal tracks for the duo – and others.</p><p>While living in Decatur with Illegal (Malik &amp; Jamal) <em>and</em> the late <a href="https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FLisa_Lopes&amp;ei=R_I4VdrSH6bPsQSojICoDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHeFworBiUY_nBgS0uf5TjmsK_1Tg&amp;sig2=nW5Z9pV3ugpQgDcTWjVaQA">Lisa Left-Eye Lopez</a>, of the trio TLC, East Koast learned first hand about the ins <em>and</em> outs of the game.</p><p>Yes, you read that last sentence correctly.</p><p>Left Eye, as he (<a href="http://ca.complex.com/music/2012/03/erick-sermon-tells-all-the-stories-behind-his-classic-records-part-1/we-getz-busy">and others</a>) describe, handled putting the duo (Illegal) together:

<em><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.1994hiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MK-Ultra-400x400.jpg" alt="" width="313" height="313" />Lisa Lopez (R.I.P) had the idea to put them (Illegal) together once she had heard from Treach (Naughty By Nature) that Malik was as mature as he (Jamal) was.</p><p>Malik was a spitter and had won all types of contests in South Carolina where our family is from.</p><p>Long story short, Left Eye came and picked us up at the waffle house, and we lived in a duplex hotel room for about two weeks before we shopped for a home.</p><p>We finally moved into a five-room house with a garage.</p><p>I stayed downstairs, and Malik's room was right across from Left eye. </em>

Crazy right?</p><p>I've been jamming his latest project with Lewis Parker, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/mk-ultra-operation-hypnosis/id962802428"><em>MK Ultra (Operation Hypnosis)</em></a>, on repeat all day.</p><p>It's ten tracks long and features no filler, just straight up hip-hop – seemingly void of time markers.</p><p>It features 16's from the likes of El Da Sensei, John Robinson and Shabaam Sahdeeq (amongst others).</p><p>What instantly drew me in was the uniqueness of his voice.</p><p>His beat selection is perfect.</p><p>His subject matter varies, and never comes off as forced or dated.</p><p>Stand out joints for me were <em>L.A to New York</em>, <em>Hustlin Junkie</em> and <em>Superior MC's</em> (with El and Shabaam).</p><p>When asked about his approach for the album, Eastkoast explained:

<em>"The approach was rooted around (the concept of) mind control, and how every "top shelf" artist has no identity.</p><p>We thought of society as a whole, and how slavery was swept under the rug – as if it never happened."</em>

In short, I loved this album ...</p><p>I'm intrigued by him as an artist, and I'll continue to champion his music here.</p><p>Be sure to follow East Koast on <a href="https://twitter.com/eastkoast">Twitter</a>!</p><p>Early.</p></div>
