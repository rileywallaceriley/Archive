  <h1>Radio That Changed Lives: The Best Hip-Hop Film Of The Past 365</h1>
  <div class="meta">Fri, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>It's unfortunate that because 90s hip-hop predated the internet and technology in its current iteration, it is so under-documented.</p><p>Much of the most amazing (verbally) recounted experiences in the timeline of hip-hop weren't captured.</p><p>That's what was so exciting about Stretch And Bobbito's documentary film, "Radio That Changed Life." Universally hailed as the greatest hip-hop radio show ever, the duo's show played host to many of the most memorable pre-stardom freestyles and moments of some of hip-hop's biggest icons.</p><p>Initially only able seen at private screenings across the nation—and in Toronto—it's now available for your next Netflix and chill session.'

What initially begins as a quasi-linear story of how the duo met, and how the show came to be, morphs into a  journey through the highs and lows of a show whose climax and ultimate end paralleled (arguably) the era most of us older heads hold dear in our hearts.</p><p>The best moments came from watching the faces of the various artists as Stretch and Bob played them their classic freestyles on a Walkman.</p><p>There were many glossy eyes—it was an oddly emotional experience.</p><p>The show's end, from Stretch's perspective, came from his dissolution with the state of music industry, and his inability to program entire episodes full of music he truly loved; the byproduct was a domino effect.

"Wouldn't you like to just go back, just to see it," asked a seemingly emotional Nas?</p><p>That—to me—was the sentiment that most of us felt watching this incredible documentary.</p><p>An excellent window into an era long gone, and a reminder of how many people were affected by not only this iconic show but hip-hop as a culture.</p><p>Lucky you, it's on Netflix; a must watch for curious young heads and anyone who considers themselves keeping it real.
