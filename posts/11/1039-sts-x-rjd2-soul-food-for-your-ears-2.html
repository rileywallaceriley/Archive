  <h1>STS x RJD2: Soul Food For Your Ears</h1>
  <div class="meta">Tue, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p><span style="line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Sugar Tongue Slim, also known to the world as STS, has an interesting background.</p><p>He first got his foot in the door when he helped pen the song <i>Oh</i> by Ciara – random right?</p><p>Well, he's worked (in various capacities) with artists such as Nas, Lloyd, Mario, Eve, and Jill Scott, just to name a few.</p><p>His new album, <i>STS x RJD2</i>, which is exactly what it sounds like, is admittedly my first introduction to him.</p><p>Good first impression.</span>

<span style="line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">I knew he was from Philly, but wasn't that shocked to hear that he was born/raised in Atlanta.</p><p>He has a southern twang that at times puts me in mind of Andre 3000 – but his delivery is very east coast.</p><p>This 12 shot album is a lot of things: melodic, soulful and <i>surprisingly</i> bar heavy.</span>

<span style="line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Some immediate tracks that jump out at me after my first few listens are the soulful <i>Doin It Right</i>, which starts the project off, the super clever <i>Trunk Of My Computer</i> and of course the track that brought STS to my attention originally <i>420</i>.</p><p>What really impressed me was the album closer <i>Fuck With That</i>, which is a flip of Jay-Z's pre-fame gem <i>I Can't Get With That</i>.</span>

<span style="line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">RJD2 is amazingly talented, with a track record of critically acclaimed heat rocks.</p><p>STS definitely benefits from working exclusively with one producer.</p><p>The project has a consistent tone/sound that maintains its momentum from top to bottom.</p><p>The result is an album that isn't a chore to listen to in its entirety.</span>

<span style="line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">STS and RJD2 have put together one of, in all honesty, the best projects I've heard this year .</p><p>Tons of replay value.</p><p>Highly recommended.</span></p></div>
