  <h1>#IndieSpotlight: Chicago Rapper Stro Is Putting On For The Southside</h1>
  <div class="meta">Mon, — aboveaveragehiphop.com</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Chicago runs the gambit when it comes to hip-hop; the Windy City is home artists like Common, Lupe, NO.I.D—often considered to be one of the godfathers of alternative hip-hip—and more contemporary 'drill' acts like Platinum selling artist Chief Keef and Durk.</p><p>Southside resident Stro sits comfortably in the middle of the spectrum, flexing a lyrical approach and a contemporary vibe that favors the city's trademark baselines amidst deep, gospel/jazzy undertones.

"My mission is to manifest the life I see for myself in my mind," Stro tells AAHH. "The goal is to influence people while fucking the bank aggressively.</p><p>When I'm on top  gon point at the tv and say 'I went to school wit him.'"

His new project, the eight-song <em>Dark Melody</em>, is a great intro to what Stro is bringing to the table, with a great ear for beats and impressive wordplay.</p><p>Give it a spin—and if you're into supporting good music, grab it from your fave music service.</p><p>Early.
