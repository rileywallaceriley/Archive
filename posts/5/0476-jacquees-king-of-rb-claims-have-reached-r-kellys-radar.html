  <div class="meta">2018-12-11 — news</div>
  <div class="content"><p>The king of R&B discussion, which was sparked by Jacquees on Monday (December 11), rages on with fans and artists alike.R. Kelly -- never one to sit idly by while a king conversation is taking place -- weighed in on the matter via Instagram.</p><p>The controversial artist seemingly missing the point though, disregarding that this is a conversation about the current generation of R&B stars.Without adding any specific quotable caption, the 51-year-old singer simply posted a photo of himself sitting on a throne.</p><p>He followed it up with a video of him exiting a hotel to be greeted by legions of screaming fans.Kelly's claim for the crown does hold massive weight, at least when it comes to a discussion spanning multiple generations.</p><p>But, the the various sexual misconduct allegations against him have put a massive stain on his career and even sparked the #MuteRKelly movement.The multi-platinum artist cannot seem to avoid controversy either.</p><p>Last week, an anonymous gun threat shut down a screening of Lifetime’s Surviving R. Kelly documentary, which explores his alleged abuse and exploitation of young black women.In a recent interview with Page Six, the singer’s ex-girlfriend Kitti Jones speculated that Kelly himself was behind the threat.</p></div>
